         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Therefore euery one that goeth vnto wickedneſſe, goeth vnder a ſhadow, a couering, a forme &amp; image of goodnes.

Séeing then, that onely the wayes of true vertues are profitable for the chiefeſt felycitie, and are in themſelues moſt bleſſed, yea and the wayes of falſe, humaine, and carnal vertues are leſſe miſerable then the wayes of vyces, we muſt needes ſay that all vyces doe growe of ignorance, the ſpring and roote of all errours and euilles. So that of a trueth ſo much miſerable a man is, as hée is gluttonous, leche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, couetous, enuious, ambitious, proude, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, or a ſeruaunt of other vyces: and ſo much is a man happye, as he is adorned with true vertues, neither can the ſaincts of God, in what ſtate ſoeuer they be founde, be rightly called miſerable, as neither the wicked can be called happie, although the blinde, fooliſh, frantike, falſe, lying, and miſerable world ſaieth, and iudgeth the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. As alſo in iudging the wiſe naught, and fooles good, it is deceyued, for it muſt néedes bée, that a man in aſmuch as he is good, in ſomuch he muſt in déede be wiſe, and as hée is naught, ſo much he is a foole, blinde, and full of pernicyous ignoraunce. As there-fore felicitie can-not bée without vertue, nor vertue without light and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, for that the one dependeth vpon the other, and they are lynked together in ſuch ſorte, that the one cannot ſpring, grow, nor decreaſe with-out the other, ſo alſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerye cannot bée without vyce, nor vyce without igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce. Then ſéeing that man is not moued to doe any thing, by euill, but by good onely, the whiche good is not found but onelye of thoſe whiche walke by the wayes of vertues, as alſo the euill is onelye founde of thoſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3278:5"/>
which walke by the pathes of vyces, we muſt néedes ſay, that they which leaue vertue for vyce, ſinne thorow ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunce: whereof grow all ſinnes, errours, miſeryes, and euills. And foraſmuch as all ignoraunces hurtfull vnto the ſoule doe ſpring of the ignoraunce or want of the knowledge of God, as of their chiefe and principall head, lyke as all our true and wholſome light doth grow and hath the firſt beginning of the light which we haue of God, therefore we muſt of neceſſitie ſay, that of the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunce of God, groweth all our euill, and all our good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe commeth of that cléere lyght, which we haue of his bountie. Inaſmuch as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is not poſſible, for vs to haue a lyuely &amp; cléere knowledge of God, and to diſhonour him, yea it muſt of neceſſitie be, that we honour him by all meanes that we poſſiblye can doe, when we haue a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall taſte, féelyng and lyght of this his goodneſſe. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as good fathers, aboue all other things, deſire &amp; are delyghted, that their children doe acknowledge the great loue that their fathers haue borne vnto them: euen ſo the contrary doth highly diſpleaſe them, knowing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that their children ſhould perceiue and taſte the great bountifulneſſe and loue of their parents towardes them, and ſhewed vnto them by diuers meanes, and yet to offend them: yea, in ſuch a caſe it forceth them to loue them, obey them, truſt in them, and honour them by all meanes that they can; and ſo if the children of God haue not the light of their fathers bountifulneſſe, they can not honour him, yea they ſhall offende him with-out hauing due reſpect vnto him. Now ſeing God, aboue all other things, requireth of vs that we know him, and is greatly diſpleaſed, when we are blinde of his ſo great goodneſſe &amp; loue, ſhewed to vs by ſo many, and excéeding meanes, and this, bicauſe that as of the knowledge of God grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all our vertue, felycitie and goodneſſe, ſo of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce of that his ſo great bountie groweth all our vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſſe, errour, miſery and euill. It is true then, that
<pb facs="tcp:3278:6"/>
as faith (inaſmuch as it includeth in it the knowledge of God) is the cauſe of all goodneſſe, ſo infidelitie (inaſmuch as it includeth the ignoraunce of God in it) is the cauſe of all euill. Let vs therefore pray dilygently vnto God, that he would giue vs of his lyght, that we may render vnto him, all praiſe, honour, and glorye, thorough Ieſus Chriſt our Lord. Amen.</p>

               <p>And finally, where <hi>Faith</hi> ſheweth vs God with ſo cleare a lyght, then for his honour we leaue gladlye all riches, pleſures, dignitie, glory, our own life, &amp; our ſelues, with yéelding our ſelues to all vexations and torments for the loue of him, as we ſée in the Martirs.

The Sainctes would not ſo had forſaken all things, if they had not had a greater light and feeling of God, then of themſelues and all creatures. All the knowledge which worldly wiſe men haue, depende vppon their thoughts: and for that loue followeth knowledge, therefore it doth neceſſarily follow alſo, that all their loue dependeth on ſenſible things.</p>
               <p>Being then that the foundation of humane creatures of all their loue and knowledge is of neceſſitie ſuch that forſaking the world, they forſake in themſelues al light loue, iudgement, reaſon, vertue and ſtrength, whereas inuincible <hi>Faith,</hi> foraſmuch as it is grounded onely in God: in condempnations and in torments, ſheweth it ſelfe moſt cleare, moſt conſtant and ſtrong.</p>

eyes of faith we do ſée things, which are in the other life. Alſo how much more the ſpirite that beléeueth is noble and more perfite of the bodily eye which ſéeth, and how much the more God (to whom faith hath regarde) is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected more perfect, mightie, ſtedfaſt, a preſent and déere friende to the ſoule, which are thinges that can-not be ſéene with corporall eyes. And further, howe much the light of faith,<note place="margin">Ioan. 8.</note> and of Chriſt (the light of the worlde and the ſonne of righteouſneſſe) is more cleare then the light of the ſunne: ſo much with more cleareneſſe and certein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is ſéene the trueth reuealed to them that haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect faith, not according as we ſée thoſe thinges whiche are before our eyes, for the corporall eye may be decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but ſo cannot the ſpiritual, in the faith be deceiued, for by the death of Chriſt all ſhadowes and figures are taken away, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all vailes and couerings, ſo that in Chriſt crucifyed we may plainely beholde God, albeit not with ſuch a great cleareneſſe as his bleſſed Angels doe. And what néede I ſpeake any more: although the light of the Church triumphant is more cleare then the light of the Church Militant,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 3. Epheſ. 3.</note> yet (as <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth) the Angels haue had in ſome parte light from the Church Militant. There is nothing therefore ſeene in this preſent lyfe, of ſo great certaintie and cleareneſſe, as the trueth which God hath reuealed vnto vs, by the which we haue a lyuely, true and perfect faith. Thou wilt ſay, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, faith is of thinges not appearing, things that are ſéene are not beléeued, and ſo alſo not hoped for, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot be ſeene with ſuch cleareneſſe and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as the thinges which be preſent before our eyes.</p>
               <p>I aunſwere and ſay that it is true whiche is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: that is to ſay, that <hi>Faith</hi> and likewiſe <hi>Hope,</hi> are of thinges not appearing, and of thinges whiche are not ſéene with corporall eyes, nor with humaine reaſon, nor yet in ſuch ſort as they are ſéene of the bleſſed: neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe <hi>Faith</hi> and alſo <hi>Hope,</hi> are of thinges appearing to

               <p>I aunſwere and ſay, that as the light of the Sunne dimmeth the light of a little canndle when it burneth, ſo the light of <hi>Faith</hi> doth by other lights of this preſent life: and yet notwithſtanding as if one were in a darke priſon, where as the Sunne doth not enter with his light, but onely by one little loope hoole he ſhoulde bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſée with a candle being lightened, the thinges that were in the priſon, then they coulde ſée thoſe thinges that bée abroade with ſo little a light of the Sunne: euen ſo the ſoule which is incloſed in the bodie, and in this worlde is as in a priſon, although it often times ſéeth better with the light of the Sunne and of carnal reaſon the thinges of this preſent life, then thoſe thinges of the other life with the light of <hi>Faith,</hi> it is not for bicauſe that the light of <hi>Faith</hi> is not farre greater then other
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3278:10"/>
lightes, but it is bicauſe we haue but a little light of <hi>Faith</hi> and great ſtoare of worldly lyght: but if wee had as much light of <hi>Faith,</hi> as wée haue of the light of the Sunne and of humane wiſdome, wée woulde not doubt.</p>
               <p>Therefore, when we doe make iudgement of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall thinges, and of thoſe things whiche wee haue before our eyes, we doubt not, bicauſe we haue nothing to gainſay vs: but when we be lifted vp to ſecreat things ſupernaturall, by and by humaine wiſedome exalteth it ſelfe in vs, where vnto, for as much as it is connaturall together with vs, we doe giue great credite, and then it beginneth with reaſons to gaineſay <hi>Faith,</hi> wherefore it is no great maruell if we oftentimes doubt.</p>
               <p>But to conclude, as Charitie is in it ſelfe more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, then all worldly loues, ſo the light of <hi>Faith</hi> is more cleare then all the lightes of this preſent life.</p>
               <p>It is alſo true, that, as to that blinde man,<note place="margin">Mark. 8.</note> to whom Chriſt gaue ſight, at the firſt, men ſéemed to him lyke trées: and that not for defecte of light, but thorough the ill diſpoſition of the member: So when GOD doth beginne to giue vs of his light, and to open the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of his diuine ſecreates vnto vs, yet oftentimes we doe not ſée plainlye the trueth, not for defecte of the light of <hi>Faith,</hi> but bicauſe the eye of the minde being turmoyled alſo with worldly thinges, is not in order to ſée the ſincere and pure trueth of God. The light then of <hi>Faith</hi> is greater then all other lights of this preſent life, yea with-out it we be in darkenes, and when we begin to beléeue, then God openeth vnto vs the Heauens, with reuealing to vs his diuine ſecreates (as it appeareth by Chriſt when he was baptiſed) and ſheweth vs the truth with this ſo cleare light,<note place="margin">Matth. 3</note> that they that haue a true &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect faith do not care for any other humaine reaſon, nor miracles.<note place="margin">Gal. 1.</note> Alſo with <hi>Paul</hi> they ſéeke not to be better clarified, to compare their <hi>Faith</hi> with the Saintes,
<pb facs="tcp:3278:11"/>
and all is thorough the great inward light which they haue. Seing then that the light of <hi>Faith</hi> is ſo cleare and great, let vs pray vnto the Lorde that he woulde giue it vs, ſo that ſeeing his goodneſſe, we may giue him al praiſe honour and glory, thorough Chriſt Ieſus our Lorde. Amen.</p>

The holy ſcriptures, and chiefelye y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſpel, ought to be had in euery language, to be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, reade, and taught to all men, and likewiſe to be hearde of euery one, ſtudyed, and learned as they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore time in the primitiue Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>To this ende was giuen to the Apoſtles the gifte of tongues, and they were enioyned that they ſhoulde goe preaching the Goſpel thorough all the worlde. Chriſt would that it ſhould be vnderſtoode of all men, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>Before time the holy Scriptures were tranſlated out of Hebrewe, and alſo out of Gréeke into Latine, bicauſe the Latine tongue, eſpecially in <hi>Italie</hi> was common to all men: there-fore they ſaid the Créede, the Goſpel, the Pſalmes, the Lords prayer, &amp; other prayers in Latine: but nowe ſéeing that the common <hi>Italian</hi> tongue is no more Latine, we ought to haue thoſe things which be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be knowne brought into a tongue which may be vnderſtoode, which thing I ſay were alſo conuenient in all other nations. I ſay not nowe, that the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the worde of God are not bounde, to ſtudie and vnderſtande better the holy ſcriptures, then the ſimple people, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they may be able (as <hi>Paul</hi> writeth) to inſtruct others, and moreouer to reſiſt and ouercome thoſe which ſhall gaine-ſay the trueth.</p>

And the errours &amp; hereſies are growen of their learned doctours: as is to be ſéene by hereticall doctrine and theologie of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</p>
               <p>And albeit that the vnlearned by ſtudying the holye ſcriptures do ſometimes fall into errours, it is not tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough defect of the ſcriptures, nor yet bicauſe it is not good that euery bodie ſhould ſtudie it but thorough their owne defect, for that they doe not ſtudy it with humily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, pureneſſe, and a right purpoſe, as they ought.</p>

                  <note place="margin">1.

fallen into a thouſand errours. They will ſaye that in ſtudying the ſcriptures they would be contented to haue vs onely, which can-not erre, for their Maſters, and to vnderſtand them according as we haue expounded, wée would not ſay that it were euill that they ſhould ſtudye them, but foraſmuch as there be many Wolues, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in theſe our times: which being cloathed in the manner of Shéepe, doe preach new doctrines, and do not expound the holy ſcriptures in many places after our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, therefore we doe not onely excommunicate, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute and burne, whoſoeuer ſticke vnto their opinions, but who ſo doe read thoſe bookes.

               <p>To this I firſt ſay, that if that be true which Chriſt ſayd, that by the fruites, by the lyfe, and by the workes,<note place="margin">Mat. 7.</note> falſe Prophets ſhall be knowen, we maye make a ſure iudgement that you be no true ſhepheards nor Paſtors of ſoules, but moſt rauening Wolues, inaſmuch as ye féede not the ſoules with the word of God, but perſecute euen to the death thoſe which preach it, being with your wicked lyuing an offence to all the world. Is it poſſible that you ſhould be ſo blinde, peruerſe &amp; obſtinate, that you ſee not how in the queſtions of your ſchoole Doctors, ther is but a lytle Diuinitie, and that moſt intricate, full of erroures and Hereſies, and you will néedes haue them for your Maſters.</p>
               <p>Who doth not ſée the obſcure, thicke &amp; palpable darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in which we were, and the great lyght which God hath giuen vs of himſelfe, within theſe few yeares? Not with any new doctrine but with the verye ſame which Chriſt preached, the Apoſtles, the Prophetes, and thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:3278:22"/>
which were true Saincts, therefore olde, although newe to thoſe which had bene blinde, for that it was a long while buried.</p>
               <p>Know you not that the light of the Goſpel is ſo great, that it diſcouereth all deceipts, errours, and falſhood?</p>
               <p>And that all the falſe perſwaſions of the worlde can doe no hurt to ſuch as be lyghtened with the truth, that is, to them which be illuminated? Whereof are you then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraide, if you with your people be in the truth together with the Goſpell? If you were in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lyght, you would not flye it, as ye doe, but would deſire and ſeeke for it, not fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly, but in truth to come vnto the toppe. But you, as thoſe which know, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> your doctrine conſiſteth in deceipts and falſhoode, fearing leaſt you ſhould be diſcouered, with making your ſelues ſuſpected, doe not onely flye as haſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as you can all counſell, but doe perſecute thoſe which preach Chriſt and his Goſpel. And it is manifeſt, that in perſecuting ſo grieuouſlye the true Chriſtians, they are not moued by zeale of the honour of God, ſéeing that in other things they ſhew no ſuch ſparkle of zeale. They are moued, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they doubt their kingdome will be brought to nothing, as a moſt vaine ſhadowe, thorough the lyght of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>And foraſmuch as they ſaye that they cannot erre, I ſay that they ſhould ſay true, if they were God himſelfe, or that they had his ſpirite: but it is ſéene by their lyfe, that they be carnall men, whoſe propertie is to be lyers. And ſuppoſe it could be, that they did not fal into ſo great errors, as not being defiled any more, they could not erre. Read with the ſpirite their decretalls and ordinaunces ſay they, &amp; thou ſhalt be pure inough. And withall this they would, that the people leauing Chriſt, ſhould ground their faith vppon them, hauing for their rule, not the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcriptures but their words.

Chriſtian, in Chriſt and thorough Chriſt ſéeth himſelfe free, as he is in déede, from all euills both of this preſent lyfe and of the lyfe to come, bicauſe that God hath ſuche a ſingular care of him, that all things doe ſerue to his ſaluation, ſo that aduerſities are to him proſperities, yea he findeth in peace war, health in ſicknes, and life in death: yea thorough Chriſt he ſéeth himſelfe, as he is, ſafe, the ſon of God and his heire, wherfore he is moſt happy, moſt noble, rich of all diuine treaſures &amp; graces.

               <p>It is manifeſt alſo that none is ſaued by the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce of the lawe diuine or naturall: bicauſe that there is no body which can doe towards God and his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour all that he ought to doe. Therefore it muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie be ſaide either that none can be ſaued, or els they that be ſaued are ſaued thorough grace. But it wer great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly amiſſe to ſay that none can be ſaued: for that God in ſuch a caſe ſhoulde in vaine haue created and preſerued the worlde, if there ſhoulde not be reaped ſome fruite thereof. Wherefore we muſt néedes ſay that ſome men are ſaued, and that by grace, and for that none can tel vs this but Chriſte, in as much as all other ſectes and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyons ſay that men are ſaued wholly, or els in parte, by the workes of men, therefore onely the <hi>Faith</hi> of Chriſt is true.</p>
               <p>There is not founde alſo any Relygion which doeth not in ſome part exalt man with diminiſhing of the grace of God, except that relygion which is of Chriſt, and that
<pb facs="tcp:3278:27"/>
onely doth debaſe a carnall man to be altogether earth, giuing all glory vnto God, and for-bicauſe this Religion cannot erre, therefore it muſt of neceſſitie be ſayde, that onely this is the true Religion of God. Alſo that God hath ſo loued ſinners, that for their ſaluation, he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed his owne Sonne to ſuffer death on the Croſſe,<note place="margin">Ioan. 3.</note> which is an acte of ſo high and excéeding loue, that if ſuch a ſecret thing, God, as a truth, had not himſelf reuealed, there is no vnderſtanding that were able to beléeue it: and therefore néedes we muſt conclude, that this was the truth. And graunt, that albeit men of themſelues had bene able to haue imagined ſo incomprehenſible a loue of god, yet they could not in any wiſe haue beléeued, that in one who was crucified conſiſted all their ſaluation, &amp; that he was both God and man, eſpecially with ſo ſtedfaſt a <hi>Faith,</hi> that for this Truth they woulde ſpende and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture their owne lyues, if God had not perſwaded this in their hearts: we muſt then néedes ſaye, that it is ſo in very déede.</p>
               <p>If Chriſt had not bene the Sonne of God, ſéeing hée would be ſo accompted, he ſhould haue bene very proude, and it is ſéene that all his lyfe was full of humilitie: It could not be hidden when men would haue crowned him if he had not fled away,<note place="margin">Ioan. 6.</note> but had ſought the friendſhip of great men, and the meanes how to haue bene exalted. It is manifeſt that Chriſt neuer ſought any commoditie to himſelfe alone, as it appeareth by his life &amp; by his words, but onely the glory of God, wherefore of neceſſitie muſt be ſayd, that he was no carnall man, but altogether di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine and ſpirituall, and ſo was his lyfe and doctrine.</p>
               <p>It is alſo manifeſt, that Chriſt willyngly tooke vpon him a ſhamefull and bitter death, and he ſaw that in dying ſo he ſhould looſe both his lyfe and all that he had, euen that worldly credit which he had, ſo that his owne diſciples would be offended,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.</note> as his proper commoditie fore-tolde him. Yea he ſhould haue ſéemed to haue loſt his ſoule, if
<pb facs="tcp:3278:28"/>
he were not the ſonne of God, bicauſe he named himſelfe ſo. No worldlye thing then coulde moue him to dye ſo, wherefore we muſt néedes ſay, that he was moued, not for his owne pleaſure, but for the truth, for the glory of the Father, and for our ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Conſider all the lyfe of Chriſt, and thou ſhalt finde that albeit it was wholly a Croſſe, yet he neuer ſhewed any ſigne of impatience, yea vppon the Croſſe, with-out any trouble of the fleſh, he ſhewed himſelfe diuine altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther euen till he gaue vp the ghoſt, and pronounced ſtill words of great charitie.</p>
               <p>Is it not manifeſt, ſéeing that Chriſt vpon the croſſe being naked, ſpoyled, and depriued of al riches, pleaſures, honours, dignities, friendes fauours, ſtrength and helpe of the worlde,<note place="margin">Philip. 2</note> humbled, brought to nothing, as if he had not bene: yea being opprobrious and accurſed of al men: hath vanquiſhed and ouercome death, the world, the fleſh, ſinnes, the Diuells, and all the enimyes of God? which he could not poſſibly haue done with-out the fauour of God.</p>
               <p>If alſo in lyke ſort his Church had not bene altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpirituall, when the fauour of the worlde decayed, it muſt alſo haue waxed féeble, whereas when the world, ſtroue againſt it, it became alwayes more mightie, forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and tryumphant.</p>
               <p>Chriſt alſo where-as in the fleſh he ſéemed weake, ariſing againe, and aſcending into Heauen to the right hande of his Father, ſhewed him-ſelfe ſo ſtronge in Spirite, that twelue vnlearned and ſimple Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, with-out eloquence, with-out learning, with out humane induſtrie and ſubtiltie, with-out ſtrength, and with-out anye promiſe of worldlye things, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with preaching that one who was crucified hath ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them, conuerted the worlde: notwithſtanding that all the armed men with their whole force reſiſted them, and with learning, wiſedome, treaſures, honoures, dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nityes,

and all other meanes which the worlde poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble coulde deuiſe. Yea, and in our time, onely with the worde of GOD, ſuch a mightie kingdome of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techriſt hath bene already decayed.</p>
               <p>There is not founde nor can be founde in the world any lyfe ſo truely holy, pure and ſpirituall, as the lyfe of good Chriſtians, which is ſo diuine, that it worketh more then myracles, and they are made ſuch thorough Chriſt crucified.</p>
               <p>An innumerable ſorte of Chriſtians haue forſaken riches, pleaſures, friendes, parentes, their countrey, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, honours, dignities, the worlde, themſelues and all, and by way of pouertie, of infamye, diſpoſſeſſed of their owne, tormented and put to death, are willyngly and ioyfully gone to Chriſt crucified: not being by anye worldly thing drawen there-to, which is moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, inaſmuch as, they were wholly naked there-off, then it muſt néedes be ſayd, that their diuinitie drewe them to it.</p>
               <p>Which thinge alſo doth appeare, not onelye bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that howe much the more they be ioyned and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited together, ſo much the more chaunging their lyfe they be renewed and doe become more humble, lyberall, holye, diuine and in all vertues moſte perfecte, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for that where-as in pleaſures, riches, honoures, and benefites of this preſent lyfe, they neuer finde reſte, béeing naked of worldlye thinges, onely in Chriſte crucified they finde the greateſt felycitye that canne bée, and this ſhoulde bée impoſſible, if that Chriſte were not the Sonne of the lyuing God.</p>
               <p>I doe lette paſſe the myracles which declare all the vertuous actes done by Chriſte and his Saints, for a Teſtimonye of the truthe of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. And the longe, continuall, cruell, irkeſome,

hatefull, dolorous, irremediable, bitter and ſhameful cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie of the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> or <hi>Iewes,</hi> for the ſinne which they committed in crucifying the Sonne of God.</p>
               <p>Let vs pray then to our heauenly and diuine Father, that of his cléere &amp; manifeſt truth, he woulde giue vs an inward lyght, ſo that we may render vnto him all praiſe, honour and glory, thorough Ieſus Chriſt our Lorde. Amen.</p>

               <p>Likewiſe alſo albeit, when one baptiſeth an other, hée is bound to ſay, I baptiſe thée in the name of the father, and of the ſonne, and of the holy ghoſt, bicauſe that Chriſt hath ſo ordeined, neuertheleſſe it is a great ſuperſtition to beléeue that in theſe wordes is ſuch a ſinguler vertue, that he which is baptiſed with them, is in any part ſaued thereby: in as much as he is ſaued onely thorough Chriſt, on whom alone dependeth all our ſaluation.

               <p>Foraſmuch as Sacraments be Sacraments by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:3278:31"/>
of Chriſt: and the conſecrating, like as the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sacraments is the office of Chriſt: the high Prieſt: and our office is manifeſted in this, that we doe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which Chriſt hath ordeyned, and that we adminiſter and vſe the Sacramentes according to that which Chriſt hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</p>
               <p>Chriſt hath not ordeined that we ſhoulde conſecrate with ſaying theſe wordes, yea, he himſelfe hath not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated with ſaying, <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> but hauing conſecrated already, he expreſſed with thoſe wordes, what we ought to take and eate. Likewiſe thoſe be ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious which beleue, that in the Letanie, in the Proceſſion, in the ringing of the Bell, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> exorciſme, in the water of Baptiſme, in the holy Water, in the holy Oyle, or in any other méere creature, is any ſinguler vertue ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</p>
               <p>The lyke I ſay of thoſe, who to the ſame ende, doe ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hearbes on Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> night: doe make for <hi>Venus</hi> holy rings, doe put confidence in reliques &amp; bodies of the Saintes, wherefore they go to viſite them, do worſhippe their Images, and haue more deuotion to one then to an other They be alſo ſuperſtitious which praye or make ſupplications for the dead, and much more if they beléeue that the torches and candells which are burned doe help them, and ſo be alſo thoſe ſuperſtitious which haue confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Indulgences, Pardons, remiſſions, abſolutions, and bleſſings of the Pope and of his members. The like alſo I ſay of all them which thinke at the leaſt in ſome part, to be companions of Chriſt in purchaſing their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, or do attribute vnto creatures more then the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall vertue that they haue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, ſome ſinguler ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue imagined of their owne heads, without hauing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God and his woord, therefore all obſeruation of place, time, number, or creature, is ſuperſtitious, if it bée w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> confidence to obtain by ſome ſupernaturall grace which is of man: for as much as God in our acts whether wée

               <p>The firſt and chiefeſt cauſe then whereoff groweth all ſuperſtition, is the ignorance or want of the the knowledge of Chriſt, him we cannot know by any our righteouſnes, health, treaſures, or goodneſſe, as he is. Wherefore to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs from all ſuperſtition, we muſt haue a true &amp; liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly light of Chriſt, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> at the preſence of Chriſt (as was aforeſaide) we deſpiſe as earth all Idolls and ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:<note place="margin">Ezech. 30.

For as much as it is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to flye the company of the wicked, but alſo that we bée inſtructed with doctrine, moued forward with good examples, prouoked with praiſe, with honour and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and with rewards, and that we put it in vſe alſo. For lyke as if one learned the ſcience or arte of Muſicke, without euer ſinging or ſounding vpon Inſtrument, hée could not bée a good Muſitian: ſo a man cannot be vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous onely by learning vertues, without putting them in vſe and doing vertuouſly. Déeds bée vnto a vertuous man more neceſſary then words.

And whereas morrall vertues, for that they are poore, miſerable, weak, abiected &amp; baſe, yea, no true vertues be gotten, &amp; therefore with ſo great paines y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to poſſeſſe them perfectly all the

whole trauaile of our lyfe time is not ſufficient, the true Chriſtian vertues, be ſo high, ritch, precious, happie, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and excellent, that they cannot by vs be purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed &amp; gotten, but are giuen by God to his elect, thorough his méere goodneſſe and grace, and his liberalitie is ſo great, that hée doth not at any time giue vs one, but all good gifts. They bée ſiſters, and in ſuch ſort bound toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that where one is, the others alſo muſt néedes bée. Wherefore the ſoule of a Chriſtian is lyke vnto a fayre garden, (whereas being the garden of God) are all flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing and ſwéete ſmelling vertues. It is alſo like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heauen full of ſtarres, adorned with all the ſtars, and a moſt perfect harmonie, where be the agréementes of all vertues, which be cléere, ſhining, honeſt, vnſpotted, and holy, which cannot abide where is any vice.<note place="margin">Deut. 32</note> God whoſe workes are perfect armeth his elect, not partly, but with all the vertues that bee. Wherfore if a perfect Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition be in ſuch admiration, thinke then what a perfect Chriſtian will bée, in whom is the harmony of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Vices be not ioyned together, and their vertues are morrall, but the Chriſtian vertues, be linked and vnited together, neither can they be poſſeſſed without Chriſt, and he that hath Chriſt in his heart, hath them all,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> foraſmuch as God in Chriſt giueth al thinges, euen himſelfe, that is, all his perfection and diuine vertues. But for bicauſe in the world we haue none other true goodneſſe then that which is diuine (as Chriſt ſaid) neither is ther any other true loue, truth, wiſdome, righteouſneſſe, ſtrength,<note place="margin">Luc. 8. 1. Ioan. 4 Rom. 3.</note> perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or vertue, then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is diuine, therfore we bée ſo much vertuous, as we doe participate of God, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth himſelfe to his children, with all his vertues, and maketh himſelfe ſo to be within them, that they are ſtrong with his ſtrenth, righteous, with his righteouſnes,<note place="margin">Pſal. 17 &amp;. 5 Ioan. 4.</note> wiſe with his wiſdome, good with his goodneſſe, and laſtly perfect in all diuine vertus, by being pertakers of him, therfore <hi>Dauid</hi> called God his fortitude, his mercy &amp; ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
<pb facs="tcp:3278:34"/>
And for that God béeing a ſpirite is not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to vs in parte, but wholely, therfore it is neceſſarye that hée which poſſeſſeth one diuine vertue, poſſeſſeth all, &amp; hée that is ignoraunt of one is ignoraunt of all: chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for that they bée in God, I will not ſaye indiſſolubly vnited, but together, and with God made one. So that as much as a man is wiſe, (to ſpeake of the true wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) ſo much he is ſtrong, righteous, godly, good, lowly, and adorned with all diuine vertues.</p>
               <p>And ſo likwiſe, howe much a man is pertaker of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine loue, godlynes, righteouſnes, or of any other perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of GOD, ſo much it muſt néedes be that hée is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of all the reſt. The true vertues then doe beginne to bée in the elect of GOD altogether, neither can the one of them growe without all the other, although many times when the occaſion doth decay, they are not diſcouered and made manifeſt. And foraſmuch as GOD doth not communicate them with vs, but onely by meane of Chriſt, the which is not layed holde on, nor embraced of vs but onely by fayth, therefore faith onely is that which ſetteth vs in poſſeſſion of Chriſt, of God, and of all his vertues. So that, as where there is no light, muſt of neceſſitie bée darkneſſe, ſo hée that hath no fayth, muſt néedes be without vertues, and full of all vices: and like as where the Sunne ſhineth cannot bée darkneſſe,<note place="margin">Rom. 14 Act. 15 Gal. 5 1.

               <p>A true and liuely fayth worketh thorough loue, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alwayes with charitie, and charitie is euer patient, gentle, lowly, and accompanied with all other vertues. He that hath fayth offendeth neither God nor his nighbour,

but repenting his ſinnes with the <hi>Nyniuites,</hi> he obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the preſeptes of God.

But foraſmuch as, although God hath bene towards vs ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall, that he hath giuen vs Chriſt vpon the Croſſe, and in him all thinges,<note place="margin">Rom. 8</note> yet one thinge, he hath reſerued for himſelfe, that is his glorie: which he neuer gaue to any other,<note place="margin">Eſay, 41.</note> nor at any time will giue, as by <hi>Eſay</hi> is declared, wherefore ſéeing by all duetie we ought to giue him the glorie and honour. I would that we might ſée in what ſort we might honour him moſt highly.</p>
               <p>And firſt, there haue bene ſome which haue thought that God is honoured moſt highly with prayer: bicauſe that he which prayeth hartely for grace at the handes of God,<note place="margin">Rom. 10</note> beléeueth that God can, knoweth how, &amp; will heare him, although he be vnworthy: It is néedefull then to haue a great light and féeling of God: and how much the more he which maketh prayers, by hauing committed many ſinnes, is not only more vnworthy to be heard, but ſhould deſerue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greater puniſhment, and by this meane craueth for the greater grace and fauour, that he might ſo much the better be able to ſerue to the honour of God, &amp; alſo that God beſtowing ſo great gifts vpon one which was ſo froward an enemie to him, doth declare vnto the world, his ſo large mercie, liberalitie, and charitie, ſo much the more as he craueth with fayth, ſo much he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth God. In Prayer therefore God is wonderfully honoured: chiefly for that in prayer all vertues be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and exerciſed. Others ſay that patience honoureth god aboue all other vertues: for bicauſe that when a man accounteth that his aduerſities be ſent from God, for his benefit, he féeleth in them not ſo much the iuſtice, as the goodneſſe and mercy of God, therfore by their meanes he eſtméeing God as his ſinguler Benefactor &amp; Father, doth not onely praiſe and giue him thanks for all things, but
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:3278:35"/>
alſo liuing in them contented, doth teſtifie vnto the whole world the good prouidence of God, ſo that, the world ſeing him ſo merry in troubles and miſeries, doth yéelde hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thankes vnto God, and is conſtrained to thinke and ſay, ſurely God dwelleth in this his creature: he coulde not ſo ioyfully beare ſuch great tribulations, if the Lord did not comfort him with his diuine grace: it is ſéene yet that God worketh and hath a ſingular care of his elect? Patience then doth meruailouſly honour God by diuers meanes. There haue bene ſome alſo which haue beléeued that there is no vertue which doth ſo much honour God, as humilitie, and their reaſon is this: bicauſe that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the humble perſon doth acknowledge all his goodneſſe to come from God, therfore he alone of all men, doth ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vnto God all thankes and glory: and if he be praiſed of any body, that praiſe he doth not attribute vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but giueth it ouer to God, remaining in his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation miſerable. There is none alſo that truly doeth know the great benefite of Chriſt, and the excéeding mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and charitie of the Father, if he féele not in truth his miſeries, and his owne diſhabilitie, to ariſe out of them, and bicauſe none but the humble man doth this, therfore he alone can render vnto God due thankes, and honour him in ſuch ſort as is conuenient. It appeareth alſo to many that loue doth moſt highly honour God, inaſmuch as when a man hath ſet his loue vppon God, he holdeth euer the eye of his minde open, ſtedfaſt and fixed vpon his glory, according to which with a right intent, he orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth all his lyfe. And further he is forced by the loue that he beareth him, not onely for his honour to doe wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full things, but alſo to procure others to doe the like.</p>
               <p>Wherefore he honoureth him by all meanes that he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly can. There haue bene alſo ſome which haue ſayde that <hi>Faith</hi> doth greatly honour God, bicauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he which beléeueth in a thing of ſo great importaunce, as is the ſaluation of the ſoule, doth put his truſt in God, with
<pb facs="tcp:3278:36"/>
forſaking all his owne wiſedome and himſelfe, and doth wholly commit himſelfe to the gouernaunce of God. And I ſay that it muſt be marked and conſidered that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery vertue doth honour God, otherwiſe it ſhould not be truly a vertue, and ſo much the more they hoonour God as they are in themſelues more perfect. Euery one that deſireth to honour God moſt highly, ought to ſeeke it not by hauing one onely vertue, but all: inaſmuch as they be all ſpirituall ſiſters, indiſſolubly vnited and knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, it is impoſſible that one of them ſhould be poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed without all the other. Euery perſon therfore, which deſireth to honour God perfectly, ought to labour dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not onely to haue all, but to haue in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée perfect vertues and to put them in exerciſe.

So that our trauayling to haue <hi>Faith,</hi> muſt not be for that we ſhould thinke, that we coulde merite it, but bicauſe without it we cannot honour God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is our duetie to deſire it, to craue it of God by grace, and to aſſaye all meanes poſſible to obtaine it.</p>
               <p>Thou wilt ſay, and what can we doe to haue it? I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere and ſay, that firſt we ought to labour to haue a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine feruent deſire and longing for <hi>Faith,</hi> without which we cannot heartely ſéeke for it, nor craue it of God. And to haue this, we muſt conſider how noble a thing <hi>Faith</hi> is, how rich, fortunate, mightie, and needful to ſaluation: foraſmuch as without it, not only we can not pleaſe God, but we be moſt damnable. It ſhould alſo be néedful for the wicked to know that they be ignoraunt thereoff, for that they appearing to haue it, as it chaunceth with the Hipocrites, ſuperſtitious people, and falſe Chriſtians, do not ſéeke nor deſire it, yea they do not humble themſelues to craue it of God, &amp; ſo the godly ought to conſider, that their faith is ſmall, for that a man doth not breathe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward grace, inaſmuch as he doth not come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his miſeries, and of his weakeneſſe to eaſe him ſelfe. And to this ende ſerueth this conſideration, that all our ſtrength is not ſufficient to obtaine <hi>Faith,</hi> nor yet our wit, our ſtudies, nor the learning, knowledge, &amp; wiſdome of the world, yea a carnal man by his corrupt nature is moſt ready to diſtruſt in God, &amp; is ſo blinde, proude, and affected to himſelfe, that with his fooliſh reaſon of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious Faith, not onely he doth not goe vnto <hi>Faith,</hi> but maketh a bulwarke againſt it.<note place="margin">Iam. 1.</note> Thou oughteſt therefore beléeue, that onely God who is the Father of light, can giue and wil giue it thée moſt largely. And to this ende ſerueth the conſideration of his great goodneſſe and large liberalitie, which is ſhewed vs in his creatures. Then if God ceaſeth not to adminiſter vnto the moſte vyle
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:3278:39"/>
wormes continually that which is neceſſary, ſo that they goe foorth and ſerue to that ende which he hath created them it muſt néedes be beléeued that hée will not forſake the ſoule for which hée created and conſerueth al things, yea for the ſaluation thereoff be dyed vpon the Croſſe, and he with the materiall Sunne lighteneth the carnall eyes of thoſe which were his enemyes, how ſhould they not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wil alſo lighten the eyes of their mindes: Thou muſt alſo ſtirre vp thy ſelfe with ſaying thus, if I truſt the earth, and therefore doe ſow and plant, the Sea and windes, and therefore doe ſayle, men and that moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, therefore doe make bargaines and couenaunts with them, why ſhould I not much more put my truſt in God, the moſt good, and my beſt Father? And bicauſe that God doth more often make himſelfe knowen with his goodnes in the holy Scriptures, then in his creatures, therfore we ought to be diligent, induſtrious, and carefull in the ſtudy of them, inaſmuch as they doe auayle greatly vnto fayth, eſpecially, if a man conſiderth, that God who is true,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.</note> is he that ſpeaketh in them, and the large and great promiſes which he doth make vnto vs, for that as by reading a wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, wherein a creadible and honeſt man is become thy debter of a thouſand Crowns, giueth thée his promiſe and fayth that he will pay thée them, ſo in reading in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures the promiſes of God, there become to thée in fayth, a warrant that God wil obſerue them. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of holy Scriptures alſo doth cauſe a man much the better to vnderſtand how with a liuely faith,<note place="margin">Rom. 10</note> the worde of God may be preached: for (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayd) fayth is by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, hearing by the word of Chriſt.<note place="margin">Act. 9.10. &amp;. 8.</note> God could immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately lighten his, yet to the intent that loue might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed amongeſt vs orderly in giuing it, the Miniſters of his woorde be appointed: as is ſéene in <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was ſent to <hi>Annanias</hi> in <hi>Cornelius,</hi> béeing ſent to <hi>Peter,</hi> and in <hi>Philips</hi> comming to the Chamberlaine.

ſinnes be forgiuen vs, and we receiue of God all giftes, benefites, and graces. But note that in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by the name is ſignified the perſon named. So that whereas it is written, that by the name of Ieſus, we haue remiſſion of ſinnes, and ſaluation, power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the ſonnes of God, to work miracles,<note place="margin">Ion. 1 Mat. 6 Ion. 14</note> and to obtayne all things, by that name of Ieſus, it is vnderſtoode of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus himſelfe. For the vertue conſiſteth not in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nor in the name, as the ſuperſtitious Antechriſtians doe ſaye and beléeue: it conſiſteth not in voice, in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, no nor in conceite, but in Chriſt himſelfe.

We muſt carye Ieſus thorough faith and ſpirite in our heartes: And they that doe ſo poſſeſſe him, be great <hi>Caballiſtes,</hi>

               <p>The true Cabal therefore conſiſteth not in charecters, in Images or letters, wherefore <hi>Moſes</hi> could not write it, nor yet Chriſt, but it conſiſteth in poſſeſſinge tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough fayth and in ſpirite Ieſus. Whereof bicauſe the

dead, and all other vertues brought to naught, yet it were not poſſible that truth ſhould faile, inaſmuch as, if a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath bene once true, it muſt néedes be that it be euer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter true, for that it hath bene a certeine time truth, it is néedful &amp; neceſſary that it be truth euer after, neither can it be contrary by any meanes. If thou haſt committed an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, it will alwayes be that thou haſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted it, &amp; it wil neuer be poſſible, that it ſhall be by thée vndone: &amp; ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if thou haſt done a vertuous deede, (it muſt be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we take heed of vitious déeds) &amp; exerciſe our ſelues in works of vertue. Truth then is without defect,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> it cannot be extinguiſhed, it well may for a time be hidden, oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and buried by the wicked. But whereas other vertues, when they are oppreſſed be féeble, &amp; many times do faint: Truth, when it is impugned, or fought againſt, awaketh it ſelfe, taketh ſtrength againe,<note place="margin">Eſdr. 3.4</note> and ſheweth it ſelfe more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, mightie and glorious. Truth then as that which is inuincible, not onely continueth ſafe and with-out anye feare in the middeſt of all the enimies, and as being moſt mightie confoundeth and ouercommeth them all, but alſo comforteth, giueth a minde and ſtrength, to al thoſe which loue it &amp; wil draw néere vnto it, ſo that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> innocent feareth not to appeare before the tribunall ſeate of Iuſtice, yea he that hath truth on his ſide,<note place="margin">Pſal. 90.</note> ſhall appeare ſafe before the Iudgement ſeate of God. Truth alwayes kéepeth compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with thoſe that ſuffer thorough loue, and giueth them Hope, comforteth them, bringeth them conſolation, it is a ſhield, with which they may be defended from all the ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings and wounds of the world: and moreouer, it maketh perſecutions pleaſaunt, cauſeth that in miſeries they bée happy, and laſtly with diſcouering it ſelfe, it doth not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delyuer from falſe miſeries, but maketh men more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious then euer they were. Peraduenture thou wilt ſay, that I might the better know the victories and triumphs of the truth, I would know what thing truth is: To this I ſay, that as if thou diddeſt make a print on a lyttle péece
<pb facs="tcp:3278:46"/>
of waxe with a ſeale, and afterward hauing put this ſeale amongſt many others, within a while after wouldſt ſéeke it out and know which it was, the way ſhould be to proue all, with the print made in that waxe, for in ſo doing, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeale would fit the print in all reſpects as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right ſeale which printed it that alone would fit it, wherefore thou wouldeſt ſay, I haue found the right feale which I ſought. So lykewiſe that thing is truth, which fitteth the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, or true according to the very perfect propertie (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome mens opinion) which we haue of that thing: and it is ſéene by experience that when a man goeth on ſéeking to vnderſtand the truth, his vnderſtanding is neuer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſatiſfied, but when he hath found it, then it remaineth ſatiſfied, quyet and contented. And foraſmuch as in the world there is in truth nothing, which wholly doeth fill, ſatiſfie, make quiet and at reſt, and is fit to our vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6</note> but God, therefore he alone is truth. But for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God in his maieſtie, dwelleth in a light which we cannot come vnto and that only in Chriſt in whome dwelleth all the fulneſſe of his diuinitie,<note place="margin">Col. 2.</note> is ſhewed vs by Ged, and may of vs be comprehended,<note place="margin">Ioan. 14</note> therefore Chriſt is ſayd to be truth it ſelfe: as he ſayd of himſelfe. Chriſt alone therefore is he, who being the very truth doth ſatiſfie and content vs, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought we to meruaile any thing héereoff, ſéeing that in him alone be hidden all the treaſures of the wiſedome and knowledge of God.<note place="margin">Col. 2.</note> So that in Chriſt, as in him who is the ende of the Law, not onely be verified and fulfilled all ſhadowes, figures, ſacrifices, oracles, prophecies &amp; ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the olde Teſtament, yea in him as in an abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">Rom. 10 1.

no meruayle, if <hi>Paul</hi> preached Chriſt crucified, the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of God, and wiſedome, and among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> he adiudged not good to vnderſtande anye other thing but Chriſt, him alone he preached, taſted,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.</note> and had before the eyes of his minde, him onely he ſtudyed, knewe, and hée was Truth, ſo that Chriſt was to him all thinges, and without Chriſt he ſaw no things but ſhadowes, vanities and falſhoode. All truthes therefore profitable and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſaluation, be in Chriſt, &amp; in him alone men ought to ſéeke them as in their proper ſpring, there can be in vs no very truth, except Chriſt lyuing in vs,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.

whole world thinking that in ſuch a caſe, God would not vouchſafe to ſend his owne ſonne by tempting man, hée thought to hinder the comming of Chriſt, and to darken his glory. This alſo (as ſome thinke) was the ſinne of the Dragon and of his company, when they fought in heauen with <hi>Michael</hi> and with the good Angells,<note place="margin">Apoc. 12 Epheſ. 1.</note> that is, for that they woulde not acknowledge their ſaluation to be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Chriſt, they would not accept him for their Lorde and head, they ſtroue againſt him, and willingly ſlew him, in ſéeking as much as they could, not onely to darken his glory, but to ſtop that he ſhould not come into the world. But lyke as then the Diuells being chaſed out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by the vertue of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Apoc. 12</note> Chriſt ſhewed himſelfe in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite mightie &amp; glorious: ſo alſo, after that the Serpent had deceiued <hi>Eue,</hi> he ſuppoſed that he ſhould haue had victorye againſt Chriſt, but God ſaid vnto him, of this woman, by whoſe meanes thou thinkeſt to haue triumph ouer Chriſt,<note place="margin">Gen. 3</note> ſhall ſpring ſeede, that is Chriſt, who with tearing downe all thy force, ſhall breake thy heade, and ſhall declare vnto the world the great vertue, power and glory of Chriſt. Alſo the great Diuell ſought afterwarde meanes, that in the world were multiplied ſo many, and ſuch great ſinnes, that the world being altogether corrupted and ful of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,<note place="margin">Gen. 6.</note> God was ſo angrye, that he vouchſafed not to ſende Chriſt, yea it euen repented him that he had made man.

               </p>
               <p>But GOD ſo much the more encreaſing them, made al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo more famous the glorye of Chriſt: And forbicauſe hée could not by this meane obteine his entent, be ſought yet to hinder the incarnation of the worde, by cauſing all the male children of the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> to be ſlayne, but GOD in ſauing <hi>Moſes</hi> who delyuered the people from <hi>Pharaos</hi> bondage with ſo greate ſignes,<note place="margin">Exod. 1</note> figured the true delyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce of the people of God, from the tyrannie of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, which is wrought by Chriſt, &amp; partly declared, what and how great the power and glorie of Chriſt ſhould bée. Sathan alſo ceaſed not, after that the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the red ſea, ſtill to hinder that Chriſt ſhould not come into the world, to aſſay by diuerſe meanes for to bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to death, euen with ſtirring vp ſo many heathen people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt him, but alwayes he remained with confuſion, and Chriſt ſhewed himſelfe in ſpirit and vertue, euermore ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt and famous. Alſo when as afterward in the lande of promiſe they had with their ſinnes &amp; vnfaythfulneſſe, (as it were) cancelled and raced out quite the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce of Chriſt. God by meanes of his Prophets refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed it agayne. And laſtly when the Scribes and Phare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes with all their humaine traditions and Ceremonies, concerning the face of <hi>Moſes,</hi> had darkend the glorye of Chriſt, then the ſonne of God appearing vpon the earth, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Angells, the ſhepheardes, the ſtarre, the wiſe men, <hi>Anna, Symion,</hi> diſcouered him to bée the Sauiour of the world. <hi>Herode</hi> perſecuted him euen to the death, and hée then in giuing ſpirituall lyfe to the innocent, ſhewed himſelfe to be the lyfe of the worlde. Sathan deuiſed that <hi>Iohn Baptyſt</hi> ſhould be in great reputation and reuerence with the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> for to darken the glory of Chriſt, and then it came to paſſe, that not onely Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> magnified Chriſt, with ſaying,<note place="margin">Ioan. 1</note> beholde the Lambe of GOD which taketh awaye the ſinnes of the worlde: and ſayde. Hee

is Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mat. 3</note> not I, neither am I worthy to vnbuckle his ſhooes, but alſo his Father from heauen declared vnto all the worlde, that he was his beloued ſonne. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell ſought in the wilderneſſe to make him fall, but hée re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned with confuſion and vanquiſhed. The Scribes and Phareſies laboured with falſe reportes and ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to ſpotte his innocencie, and Chriſt with his pure doctrine and holy lyfe, ſhewed himſelfe euerye daye more cléere, bright and pure: The Scribes and Phareſies la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to perſwade the people, that Chriſt not onely was not the true Meſſias, but that he was contrarye to the lawe, and the Prophets, and Chriſt with verifiyng in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe all the prophecies, and with hauing in the mounte <hi>Thabor,</hi> the teſtemonie of <hi>Helyas</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſhewed all the contrarye. How much the more they ſought to kéepe cloſe the diuinitie of Chriſt, ſo much the more with myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles he ſhewed foorth the ſame.</p>
               <p>Alſo howe much the more they ſought to put downe his myracles, ſo much the more they came to lyght. At laſt they deuiſed with murmurings, backbitinges, infamyes, with ſlaunders, falſe accuſations, and witneſſes, with wicked iudgements, with abuſes, beatinges, with ſettinge him at naught, as rybalde, and with hanginge him vppon the Croſſe betwéene two théeues, as the principal and laſt they thought with ſo ſhamefull a death to extinguiſhe all his fame,<note place="margin">Ioan. 8.</note> name, creadite, and reputation, and then didde he moſt ſingulerlye ſhewe himſelfe the lyght of the world, and more full of force and power then euer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>They buryed him with ſealing vp the Sepulchre, and watchinge it, but thereby they made his reſurrection ſo much the more meruaylous, and glorious. They cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the Souldyers with money, to the intent they might ſaye that hée was not riſen agayne, but that his Diſciples had taken awaye his bodye, and CHRIT
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:3278:48"/>
ſhewed himſelfe to his Diſciples riſen againe.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, when they had ſought with all theyr pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſubdue him, then was hée glorious aſcended into Heauen.</p>
               <p>And for that they coulde not perſecute him any more in the fleſh, therefore they beganne to perſecute him in his elect, with whome hée was ſtill abidinge with his ſpirite,<note place="margin">Mat. 28</note> but on the daye which wée call Pentecoſte hée ſo filled them with lyght, zeale, ſtrength, and grace, that without any feare they beganne to preach openly: they were forbidden with many threates by the Princes of the Iewes, to preach Chriſt any more,<note place="margin">Act. 2.</note> but they coulde not refrayne from it,<note place="margin">Act. 4.</note> they ſayde that they coulde not holde theyr peace of that which they had hearde and ſéene, and it was more méete they ſhoulde obeye GOD then men. They were oftentimes impriſoned with many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries, beaten &amp; ſcourged, and they with reioycing ſuffered all, and gaue thankes to GOD,<note place="margin">Act. 5</note> that they were made worthy to ſuffer for CHRIST, they went forth prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge more vehementlye then euer they dyd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, when the Iewes, bicauſe they woulde hide the truth of the Goſpell, chaſed the Apoſtles out of Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye, then was it that they beganne to preache thorough out all the world.</p>
               <p>And albeit in euery place they were gayneſayde and forbidden, yet the worlde coulde not withſtande the wiſedome giuen by God to his Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, howe much the more Tyrauntes dyd ſéeke to extinguiſh and deface the truth of the Goſpell,<note place="margin">Act. 28</note> with ſheddinge the bloude of Martyres, ſo much the more it ſhewed it ſelfe cléere, brighte, glyſteringe, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, mightie, and glorious. So that not onely the godly do ſerue to the glory of Chriſt, but alſo the wicked againſt their wills.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:3278:49"/>Finally, the Antechriſtians, as thoſe which be aboue all others the greateſt enemyes of Chriſt, haue deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with all poſſible craft, ſubtiltie, peruerſneſſe, malice, deceite, and ſtrength, to hide and quench out the cléere lyght of the Euangelicall truth, and this with their ſuch falſe doctrines, humayne inuentions, and diuelliſh, approued with wonders (wrought therefore as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth) by Sathan,<note place="margin">2.

               <p>And furthermore they haue laboured to bring to naught the fayth of Chriſt, with al diſhoneſtie, ſimonie, extortion, treaſons, hatreds, partialitie, warres, and ſinnes of the worlde.

He ſtrengtheneth theyr mindes, comforteth them, ayedeth and giueth them ſtrength: hée maketh their perſecutions pleaſaunt, and making them ſafe at laſt, they doe triumph ouer all the enimies of God.</p>
               <p>Séeing then that Chriſt who is truth, not onely is

And forbicauſe the Turkes, the Iewes the Infidells, and likewiſe the Papiſtes doe not knowe Chriſt in truth, therefore it muſt be of neceſſitie ſayde, that they knowe not GOD. And that theſe doe not knowe Chriſt in truth, is manifeſt, for that Chriſt is not knowe truely, but of them which ſée him by all his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, ſanctification, wiſedome, and ſaluation, as the <hi>Euangeliſtes,</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is ſéene by experience, that the deſire to doe a thing helpeth much to the dooing thereoff. When a ſcholemaſter hath made a willingneſſe to learne to come vnto his ſchollar, he hath done that which is moſt neceſſary and hard. And bicauſe I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous that euery one ſhould be a good Chriſtian, &amp; I know that it were greatly profitable that men were willyng: inaſmuch as if one deſire to become good, he commendeth himſelfe to God, and goeth on ſéeking by all meanes and wayes that he poſſibly can for to be good. But for bicauſe he can not hartely deſire to be a good Chriſtian, if hée knoweth not how to diſcerne of a Chriſtian, yea this is one of the cauſes why there be ſo few good Chriſtians, for that euery body thinketh himſelfe to be one, therfore they be not chaunged, ſo they doe interprete after their owne faſhion. The not deſiring it therefore groweth of this, that we ſéeme to our ſelues Chriſtians, although wée bée not: Wherefore I haue thought it expedient to ſhow that good Chriſtians are fewe, bicauſe that he which is none, doth yet acknowledge himſelfe to be. Mine enterpriſe is great and difficult, that I ſhould goe about to perſwade that Chriſtians are but very few: not for bicauſe I haue not on my ſide moſt lyuely and ſtrong reaſons, but for that a matter is hardly perſwaded which is diſpleaſaunt vnto me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If I wold proue that euery one who is baptiſed

is a good man, it ſhould be an eaſie matter for me to do, for euery body woulde conclude my reaſons, although they were without any foundation: foraſmuche as he that ſpeaketh a gratefull and pleaſaunt thing, is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily allowed. But to proue that they be no Chriſtians, I know that I ſhall haue a great reſiſtaunce. Many there be which confeſſe Chriſt with their mouthes, but fewe with their heart, ſo that very fitly their euill workes will confirme and further myne indiſſoluble reaſons.</p>
               <p>There be found two ſortes of fayth, one purchaſed, an other inſpired. A purchaſed fayth is that whiche is found in all thoſe that were baptiſed in their youth, which beléeue in Chriſt, bicauſe they haue ben ſo taught by their parents, &amp; bicauſe they ſée others beléeue ſo, and eſpecially thoſe that haue ben accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted learned, wiſe, and holy, yea, the Church the which they thinke cannot erre, and that it is guyded by the holy Ghoſt. They haue alſo an opinion y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the holy Scriptures be giuen by God for a confirmation of their fayth, &amp; likewiſe the myracles, &amp; bicauſe it hath bene ſo perſwaded them w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> many probable reaſons, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be come into an opinion of fayth of the matters of Chriſt, and this, the ſooner bicauſe they haue ben ready to beléeue, or rather there haue bene ſome which knewe how eaſily to perſwade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But now this is no fayth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired, but a purchaſed fayth, albeit it be of things ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, for bicauſe they haue theroff but only an humane opinion: ſo much they beléeue, as hath ben perſwaded them with probable reaſons, and as much as their weake and blinde reaſon is capable off. And their faith (foraſmuch as it is purchaſed) is lyke vnto that which the Turkes haue of <hi>Mahumet:</hi> their beléeuinge, is of lyke ſort, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they likewiſe haue ben ſo taught of their parents: they ſée thoſe alſo which they account learned, wiſe and holy, to beléeue ſo: they thinke that their heades or chiefe men and their Church cannot erre, and that they be gouerned and inſpired by God. And that their <hi>Alcorane</hi> is a diuine thing
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:3278:52"/>
and confirmed with many myracles, they ſée as great men beléeue it as they be, and likewiſe by other apparaunt reaſons, they be come into that opinion and fayth. So that if they had bene borne and brought vp among Chriſtians, they would beléeue as we doe: likewiſe Chriſtians who haue none other but a puhchaſed fayth, if they had bene borne and brought vp among Turkes, they would beleue as they beléeue. Wherefore both the one &amp; alſo the other, in this reſpect, is a humane opinion, although theirs bee of falſe thinges, and ours of true. Now therefore this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is not ſufficient to be a good Chriſtian, and to come to ſaluation, inaſmuch as, this is an obſcure fayth, full of darkeneſſe, vnſtéedfaſt, which alwayes wauereth, ſtacke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and doubteth, it ſéeth not the truth with a cléere and ſupernaturall lyght, it is a barren fayth, vnfruitefull, colde, idle, earthly, carnall, humaine, purchaſed and dead, which ſtandeth with euery great ſinne, wherfore is not ſufficient to ſaue vs. And if it were, then euery wicked Chriſtian woulde be ſaued, yea, euen the Diuells, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they beléeue that God is Almightie, that he hath made the worlde, that Chriſt is his ſonne conceiued by the holy Ghoſt, borne of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> crucifyed, dead and the reſt of the Articles. Yea, to ſpeake of a purchaſed fayth, they haue more then we. Wherefore this fayth is not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which maketh any perſon a Chriſtian in truth, but maketh him onely a maſking Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>But there is found an other fayth, which commeth downe from heauen, altogeather diuine, ſupernaturall, cléere, full of lyght, burning, zealous, liuely, and working, which is the gift of GOD, and dwelleth not idle in any, as many haue ſayde: it is a cléere lyght and ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, which ſheweth the diuine and reuealed truth,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2</note> in an other faſhion, then humane reaſon can doe. This was in <hi>Peter,</hi> when hauing hadde reuealed to him that CHRIST was the ſonne of GOD, and confeſſing him to bée ſo, Chriſt ſayde.<note place="margin">Mat. 6</note> It is not fleſhe and bloude

                  <hi>Faith</hi> which maketh men in truth Chriſtians. To know therefore whether thou be a Chriſtian or not, thou muſt needes marke whether thy <hi>Faith</hi> be inſpired or purchaſed: which thou ſhalt firſt know, for that he which hath a purchaſed <hi>Faith,</hi> conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth himſelfe with that, chiefely the learned, he thinketh to haue inough by them, and this bicauſe he féeleth not with that <hi>Faith,</hi> the goodneſſe of God, wherefore they abide ſo colde, without hauing any certeine feruent deſire to haue more lyght of <hi>Faith.</hi> But an inſpired <hi>Faith,</hi> is a firie light, which therefore maketh thée to féele the goodneſſe of God,<note place="margin">1.

And in lyke manner manye when they haue perceiued any great ſinne in thoſe whom they accounted relygious and holy, they haue bene offended, &amp; haue loſt their <hi>Faith,</hi> yea many were wont to ſaye vnto ſuch as thoſe be, take heede to your ſelues, for bicauſe our <hi>Faith</hi> is wholly placed in you.

Humane fayth is ſo mutable &amp; inconſtant, that one while it beleeueth this an other while that, accordinge as it is perſwaded. Therefore all ſo many mindes, opinions, faythes, ſectes, and hereſies, which be in the world are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together humane: but the diuine fayth abideth ſtéedfaſt in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth, without euer chaunging.

And moreouer, bicauſe they beléeue not that there is found any other ſorte of fayth, but theirs, they doe thinke that it is a blaſphemie, to ſaye, that fayth alone iuſtifieth, and ſo they be conſtrayned to truſt in themſelues, and in workes, and to extoll man, with falling from the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, &amp; with darkening Chriſt, his grace, his goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and his glory.</p>

There may be then a good Prince and the ſame a perfect Chriſtian, as many were both in the olde and newe Teſtament: yea, none can in truth be a good Prince, if he be not a good Chriſtian. Inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he which is without true Religion and fayth, it muſt néedes be that he is ignoraunt of true wiſedome, of true righteouſneſſe, ſtrength, charitie, temperaunce, and all other vertues. If a Prince be not a Chriſtian, he ſhall neuer haue ſuch ſincere, pure, and diuine loue to his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, as is conuenient, he ſhall neuer be mortified to the world and himſelfe, and liuing vnto the honour of God, he ſhall not haue ſo graue manners, ſo ripe, ſound and holy, as he that hath fayth in Chriſt. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God would ſaue of all ſortes of men,<note place="margin">1.

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:3278:57"/>
and ſo much more harde a thing it is to finde Chriſt in a Prince, as in this our age, the corruptions of the moſt part (accounted for moſt holy Lawes) be greater, their libertie and power more tyrannicall, their willes more vnbrideled, and flatterers which ſerue them in ſtéede of mightie men are great in aboundaunce, ſo that we may ſay with the Phariſeyes &amp; high Prieſtes of the Iewes,<note place="margin">Ioan. 7.</note> which of the great men haue beléeued in Chriſt? there is none but the ſimple and poore people that beléeue in him. Alſo the Iudges, Aduocates, Procurators and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries might be good men, and doe offices and déedes of great charitie, it is true that they ought to be of another ſort then they commonly are. And lykewiſe alſo a man might be a ſouldiour and yet a good Chriſtian, as was the <hi>Centurion:</hi> but it ſo hard,<note place="margin">Mat. 8.</note> that it is next neighbour to a thing impoſſible. The lyke I ſay of other honeſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of the world, in which euerye one that is founde therein by the will of God, ought to turne vnto his ſayd Lord God all his intents, thoughts, will, actions, and workes, with ordering al his lyfe to his honour &amp; glory.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is found in the worlde a prudence and wiſedome which is carnall, profane, humane and diueliſh: and an other that is ſpirituall, holy, Angelicall, and diuine. Of the firſt <hi>Paul</hi> maketh mention, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he ſayed. Be you not wiſe in your owne opinions. And likewiſe when he ſayd, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of this world was fooliſhneſſe before God,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 1. Cor. 3.</note> and in many other places. Of the ſeconde <hi>Faith</hi> Chriſt made mention, when he exhorted the Apoſtles to be wiſe as Serpents:<note place="margin">Mat. 10. Mat. 15.</note> and alſo when he tolde of thoſe fiue virgins, who entred with him into the mariage. Chriſt alſo ſpake both of the one and of the other, when he ſayd that the children of this world,<note place="margin">Luc. 16.</note> be more wiſer then the children of lyght, and foraſmuch as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greater part of men, leauing off to be gouerned with ſpirituall prudence and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, be gouerned with carnall, by which they fal head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into great daungers: therefore I haue iudged, that it wil not be vnprofitable to ſhew vnto ſuch partly their fooliſhneſſe. Firſt, ſpirituall prudence and wiſedome, as that which hath a great light, cleare, ſupernaturall and high, holdeth alwayes the eyes open, fixed, and ſtedfaſt vpon God, hauing him alone for the laſt end, vnto whoſe glory it ordereth all our actions, and workes, vſing all creatures to his honour.</p>
               <p>But carnall wiſedome and prudence, as that which hath ſmall lyght and a feeble diſcerning, openeth not the eyes vnto God, but vnto the worlde and to the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:3278:58"/>
thereoff, which it accounteth to be the latter ende of all things: and if it ſometimes hath reſpect vnto God, that is a farre off, and vnperfectly: it cannot fixe ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the eyes vppon God, nor account him for his laſt end, but it is offended at his great lyght, is conſtrained to holde downe the face and to get it away with the Bats flying about into the darke &amp; inextricable dennes of the vayne ſhadowes of the worlde, with ſeeking to reſt in them, ſo that he cannot vſe God as his Lord, but ſéeketh for his owne gayne to vſe and to ſerue that, as though the other wiſedome were a thing lytle worth: Like as is ſeene by experience in carnall men, which loue not, come not neere, eſteeme not, feare not God but for their owne lucre. They reſpect therefore humaine wiſedome, and holding theyr eyes open and fixed not vppon God, who is in truth our laſt ende and refuge, but vpon plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, treaſures, honours &amp; other benefites of the world, it muſt neceſſarily be ſayd, that as a man ſhoulde be a very foole, if when he woulde goe into the Eaſt partes, ſhould chooſe for his guyde one that would conduct him into the Weſt, lykewiſe thoſe be fooles, which béeing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to goe vnto God and to felycitie, which is not founde but in him alone, doe chooſe to lyue and to bée gouerned after carnall prudence and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p>But manye will ſaye: Wouldeſt thou not that wée ſhoulde profite our ſelues with that humaine prudence and wiſedome which GOD hath giuen vs, at the leaſt yet in worldlye thinges? thinkeſt thou that GOD woulde haue giuen it vs, if it had not bene good for ſome thing? it is not now to be thought that God hath giuen it vs in vayne. Doeſt thou thinke that wée woulde lyue by chaunce, and not gouerne our ſelues according to the wiſedome that God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs? ſurelye wée maye not deale ſo fooliſhly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:3278:59"/>Now to ſuch as theſe be I aunſwere and ſaye, that if carnal wiſdome wer of God, it ſhould not ſo be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempned in the holy Scriptures as it is: wherefore it muſt néedes be ſayd, that it is naught and diueliſh. And what is carnal wiſdome els, but the ignoraunce of God, therfore ſinne? &amp; it is not onely the ignorance of God, but alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of creatures, which if they knew him, he néede not ſo be ſhewed forth vnto vs for to be our laſt ende as he is, we would not ſo be perſwaded to ſéeke &amp; enioy this wiſdome as we do, without hauing reſpect to the honor of God. Knoweſt thou what prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; wiſdom that is which God giueth, and is commended in the holy ſcriptures, it is that which guyding vs, we ſée God, to be God, &amp; our laſt ende, &amp; the creatures to be creatures, and by due meanes do ſerue to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> honour of God, as is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall prudence and wiſdome to doe. I ſay not then that men ſhould lyue by chaunce, but I ſay that in all theyr lyfe, in all their actions &amp; workes, euen in worldly things they ought to haue God alwayes before theyr eyes, and to order all their lyfe to his honour and glorye, ſo that although one would purchaſe him apparell or any other worldly commoditie, he ought not to deſire it, but ſo as he might vſe it to the glory of God, he ought not to ſéeke it, but with honeſt and iuſt meanes, without diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring God in any wiſe: Lyke as he doth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is gouerned &amp; guyded with the wiſedome of God. But they that bée guyded w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> worldly wiſdome, locking their eyes againſt the glory of God, and fixing them vpon worldly thinges, with all craft, ſubtiltie, malice, deceipts, treaſon, extorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, vſury, rauening, vyolence, &amp; by al other meanes poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which may turne to their gaine, without hauing any litle reſpect to the honour of God, do ſéeke to haue &amp; to vſe things, not to the glory of God, but to their own benefit. It is manifeſt therfore y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuch wiſedome as this is, is not of God, bicauſe it is euill and diueliſh: and God would, that it ſhould vtterly be lefte. But I would thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:3278:59"/>
vnderſtande, that thoſe which be gouerned with humaine wiſedome, be fooles, not onelye for bicauſe they forſake to be guyded on the contrarye, reſpecting the ende, but alſo reſpecting the meanes: inaſmuch as although one woulde, with-out hauing anye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecte vnto GOD, make him-ſelfe happye in this world by ſuch meanes as he can, he ought not in anye wiſe be guyded after humane and carnall wiſedome: bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſo blinde, frantike and fooliſh, that not onelye thou canſt not know how to finde the due meanes, but contrariwiſe it will make thée moſt miſerable, euen in things of the world. And that this is true, put caſe thou finde a man who hath no Religion, and that is as it were a beaſt, beleeueth not that there is found any God nor other lyfe. Now in ſuch a caſe, if this man would make himſelfe happy in this preſent life, he muſt liue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the faſhion of brute beaſtes, with taking day by day, all thoſe pleaſures that hée could obtaine, without fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting therefore, and not to thinke of the time to come in any wiſe: for that, immediately when this man would begin to héede that, to heape vp, and make gardeines in the aire, with that his carnall wiſedome, he ſhould enter into a thouſand cares, penſiueneſſe, thoughts, trauailes, feares, ſuſpitions, hatreds, paſſions, torments, miſeryes and helliſhneſſe; and ſo he ſhould he moſt miſerable, not onely by béeing without God, but alſo by being ignorant of himſelfe, with his owne proper wiſedome, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſmall felicitie which he might haue in this life, in ſuch ſort as other liuing creatures haue. So that I iudge, that if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion be taken away from man, it were better for him to be a beaſt, then a man with wiſedome. Humane wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome then, as that which is diueliſh and moſt euill, can not but hurt a man, in what eſtate ſo euer it poſſeſſeth him.</p>
               <p>That was it which béeing figured by the Serpent, cauſed the firſt parents to looſe their happy and bleſſed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate.
<pb facs="tcp:3278:60"/>
Wherefore they be of all other moſt fooliſh &amp; miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, who leauing the bridle in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hands of a carnal wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, do commit themſelues wholly to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked, perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious &amp; franticke gouernaunce there-off, although the blinde world doth extoll ſuch men for wiſe and happie men. And know that this humane wiſedome is ſo ſtiffe-necked, that it cannot yeelde it ſelfe to vnderſtande the truth which if it could be capable off, it ſhould no more be carnall, but ſpirituall, ſo that humane wiſedome is none other but an incurable phrenſie, &amp; more-ouer it is ſo blynde of it ſelfe, that not onely it hath taken in hande to order the worlde, with diſordering it euerye day more and more, but it preſumeth to iudge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempne euen God in his workes, as though it wer his ſuperiour both in wiſedome and righteouſneſſe. But wilt thou ſée if it be méere fooliſhneſſe? then thinke and conſider, that albeit in Chriſt all the treaſures of the wiſedome and knowledge of God doe conſiſt, yet this (as a foole) will euen read it to be true in their parents, ſaying that God was madde and out of his wittes: Chriſt, &amp; likewiſe his Church, neuer had, nor at any time ſhall haue, a greater enimye then this. This humaine Faith is it that hath alwayes perſecuted grace, and the Goſpell, and with deuiſing euery daye new ſortes of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing after the owne fantaſie, hath filled the world with ſuperſtitions, idolatryes, ſectes, hereſies and wicked re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions. And laſtly that is it which, although it hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes perſecuted the Sainctes, and hanged Chriſt vppon the Croſſe, yet in the kingdome of Antechriſt, in ſhewing more wickedneſſe then euer it did, hath done and doth the laſt vyolence.</p>
               <p>It is therefore exceeding fooliſhneſſe, miſerye and wickedneſſe, for a man to ſuffer himſelfe to be guyded thereby: Lyke as it is moſte high wiſedome, godly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and felicitie, to be gouerned and guyded with Faith, ſupernaturall lyght, and ſpirituall wiſedome:
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:3278:60"/>
foraſmuch as ſuch hauing God for their laſt ende, goe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him happely by due meanes, with vſing all creatures to his glory.</p>
               <p>Let vs pray vnto God therefore, that he woulde giue vs of his lyght, that he would quench and put out in vs all carnall wiſedome: ſo that lyuing onelye vnto him, we may yéeld him all praiſe honour and glory, thorough Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, Amen.</p>

               <p>The other deſperation is altogether diueliſh and moſt wicked, as when a man diſtruſteth and diſpay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of the helpe of God.

is no God, or that if there be, he cannot, or that he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not how to helpe him, and if he knoweth how and can, that hée will not, that he loueth him not, that he doth not fauour him, eſtéeme him, hath not elected him, neither that he hath a moſt ſingular care of him, yea hée thinketh that God is partiall, and an acceptor of perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that he is his enimie, cruell and angry with him, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeueth not that thorough Chriſt he is pacified with him.

And what worſer thing can a man doe, then to diſtruſt of that ſo great and infinite goodneſſe, loue and mercie of God, made manifeſt to vs moſt highly in Chriſt? The ſinne of deſperation ſo much diſpleaſeth God, that if we ſhould goe on duely conſidering thereof, we ſhoulde finde that what great workes God hath wrought from the beginning of the worlde euen vntill now, all hath bene for to eleuate and drawe our <hi>Hope</hi> vnto him, and bicauſe that we ſhould not fall into deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.

promiſed vs all the foreſayd things, and that abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as it is euident in diuerſe places of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but already in Chriſt, and thorough Chriſt hath obſerued the ſame, as may be ſéene in ſo many Saints as haue bene ſaued. Séeing that we haue experience, which is ſuch a Miſtres, that maketh vs ſée playnly the truth, with making vs in the ende to féele the ſame. If a Prince beſides his abilitie &amp; that thou knoweſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teynly he is a good man, knoweth howe, and will helpe thée aſmuch as he can, that he is determined to take thée for his ſonne, and hath promiſed thée ſo, that he hath alſo beſtowed vpon thée many benefites, and ſtill day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth, in the ende for thy benifite, he offered his owne ſonne to dye, in ſuch a caſe, wouldſt thou not truſt him? yes truely.

we, although we be in the Sea of this miſerable &amp; tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous world, already thorough our ſinnes ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in by Sathan, and God for all this preſerueth vs, we yet doe not in any wiſe ſeale his grace, his benefits, in his goodneſſe, and we thinke that creatures, and not God doth ſuſteyne vs. God beeing willing to make vs ſure of our ſaluation, coulde not giue vs any greater knowledge &amp; ſigne of our ſaluation, then his own ſon vppon the croſſe, nor a more ſure pledge, then his owne ſpirit.

               <p>Wherefore we doe a moſt great iniurye to God, if wée truſt not in him. And ſo much the greater as on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part, beſides God there is nothing, in whiche wée ought or may iuſtly put our confidence. And this, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that creatures be all moſt vaine ſhaddowes the which as without the good will of God they cannot hurt vs, ſo they cannot helpe vs. Séeing that the thinges of this world are not ſtéedfaſt, the whéele thereoff alwayes turneth, therefore if wée arme them vpon vs with our own Hope, we muſt néeds be in continual turmoilings, miſeries, and trauayles. The men alſo in whom GOD doth not reigne, although they appeare now thy déere friendes, or they be now thy bounden kinſfolkes, and to reach a great way, they wil ſhew themſelues to be ſelfe louers, lyars, vnfaythfull, and trayterous.

And if that ſometimes we haue any ſmal opinion of God that he regardeth vs, by and by knowing that we haue offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, and not ſéeing that he is pacified with Faith in Chriſt, and that he is our moſt deare Father: we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine him to be as a moſt ſeuere Lord and Iudge, angred againſt vs: wherfore we can not place any of our <hi>Hope</hi> in him: but he conſtrayned with our firſt Father to run away, to hyde vs and to diſtruſt of him. So that albeit it ſhould happen, that we being forſake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all creatures, ſhoulde be driuen to haue refuge vnto God, we ſhoulde not altogether recommend our ſelues in any wiſe with our whole hearts vnto him, nor with a ſtedfaſt confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and ſure <hi>Hope</hi> to be heard, as is fit and conuenient for vs to doe: and ſo much the more, as that God hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſuffered the like, we could not thinke that he would haue compaſſion of vs. Whereas on the other parte, for that the creatures be afore our eyes, we haue with them agréement and lykeneſſe, they haue ſome pitie of vs, and a great deale of themſelues, they not onely haue not ben by vs hurt and iniuried, but haue receiued benefites at our handes, we are bent to put our truſt in them rather then in God: and eſpecially in men, bicauſe they are of the ſame forme and kinde that we be, and ſingularly in friends and kinſfolke, bicauſe they are moſt néere vnto vs: but aboue al, we are inclined to truſt in our ſelues, being vnto vs (I will not ſay) more lyke and néere, but one and the ſelfe ſame thing with our ſelues.

For the Sonne of God deſcending from heauen, hath taken it vppon him, not the Angells, but the ſéede of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to the intent that he béeing to vs the next neighbour, lyke to vs, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame forme, man together with vs, our déere friend, our next kinſman and brother, we ſhould be altogether vnexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if we doe not put our confidence in him. And ſo much the more as with his ſpirit, with a ſpeciall illuminating to his elect, he maketh them more properly féele, that it is not their owne ſpirit. For this cauſe alſo Chriſt would, both in his paſſion and in other things, except in ſinne, be made lyke vnto his bretheren, to the intent y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Chriſt our high Prieſt hath experience our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, we might thinke that he will haue compaſſion on vs, and ſo we might truſt in him.

At all times therefore when we conſider of God without Chriſt, by diuers reſpectes we can-not haue a true Hope in him, inaſmuch as he appeareth to be a very great way off from vs, vnlike vs, &amp; ſuch a one as we are not worthy off, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth not néere vnto, that he loueth vs not, that he eſtéemeth vs not.

Alſo that <hi>Hope</hi> which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny haue is not true, who beléeue that God will beſtowe his gracious giftes vpon him, thorough the interceſſion of Saints, or of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> They wickedly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that the Saints and Sainteſſes, whileſt they were in this preſent life, did workes which wer in themſelues of ſuch goodneſſe and excellencie, that by them they did merite, not onely that glory in which they are, but that alſo moreouer they deſerued to be heard, when they bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Paradice doe pray for vs. This alſo is not true <hi>Hope,</hi> ſéeing in ſome parte it is founded vppon mennes workes. It is very true, that I maye and ought intreate people that be in this preſent lyfe, that they would make prayers for me, to exerciſe vs in vertue, and not bicauſe I ſhould thinke that they muſt of neceſſitie be hearde thorough the worthineſſe and excellencie of their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but onely thorough Chriſt and the méere goodnes of God: Now this is the true <hi>Hope,</hi> founded wholly in the bountifull goodneſſe of God, and therefore moſt ſure and certaine. Lykewiſe to ſpeake of worldly thinges, I ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thoſe be no true Hopes, which beeing mens guides they hope to haue preſeruation or recouery of health, by meanes of Phiſitians or Medicines, with putting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence

Now all theſe are preſumptions, and not true <hi>Hopes,</hi> bicauſe they be not founded vppon God, but in things of this world: wherefore ſuch as they be, doe often remaine with confuſion, being vaine, and no true <hi>Hopes.</hi> There be alſo many which although they hope to haue of God temporall benefites, goods corporal and ſpiritual and heauen it ſelfe, and that by no meanes, either of Saints or merits, but onely by the méere grace of God and by the merites and interceſſion of Chriſt, neuertheleſſe their hope is not true, although it be gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

They deſire and hope that tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Chriſt and the pure goodneſſe of God, they ſhall haue proſperitie in this world, and afterward heauen, but for their ioyes and triumphes, and not for the meere glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God. But this is no true hope: inaſmuch as true <hi>Hope,</hi> being the Theologicall and diuine vertue, like as it hath God onely for the foundation euen ſo it hath him alone for the refuge and ende. So that as Loue when it is ſet vppon creatures, is no more ſo ſincere a loue, nor ſo pure, ſpirituall, diuine and full of Charitie, as it is, when it ſeeketh the glory of God, and furtherance of his Goſpell, but is carnall &amp; prophane: ſo when our hopes be ſet on pleaſures, treaſures, honours, dignities and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities, without being directed and eleuated vnto God,
<pb facs="tcp:3278:68"/>
they are no true Hopes, but falſe, vayne and deceiptful. Seing then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true <hi>Hope</hi> is founded wholly vpon God, and who ſo hath him alone for his refuge and ende, can not be confounded, yea it is neceſſary that we obtayne all that which with the ſayd <hi>Hope</hi> we looke for. For to vnderſtand this truth, we muſt firſt know, that lyke as Charitie is nothing els but a ſpirituall loue of God, and of creatures for his honour and glorye: ſo <hi>Hope,</hi> is no other thing but a ſpirituall deſire of the glorye of God, and of other things to this ende and purpoſe, with a ſure and ſafe expectation, that God wil graunt me that being for his glory, lyke as if, for an example, I hope to haue at Gods hand ſome temporall benefite, either corporall or ſpirituall, this hope in me is nothing els but a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall deſire that I haue of the foreſayd things, for the glory of God, and not for mine owne gayne, with a ſure and certaine expectation that God will giue it me when it is for his glory, not for any merite of mine, but onely for his méere goodneſſe, and for Chriſt who dyed for me vppon the Croſſe. And foraſmuch as when we ſhall bée in Heauen, we ſhall haue all that we can and ought to deſire, therefore béeing without deſires and expectation of any better thing, we ſhall be alſo with-out Hope as <hi>Paule</hi> did write.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13</note> And héere it may be ſéene how they are deceiued which ſaye, that a man maye beléeue both good and euill, but no man can hope for anye thing but that which is good, nor feare any thing but that which is euill: ſo that according to their opinion, a man might agreeably ſay, I beléeue that I ſhal haue proſperitie, and alſo aduerſitie, but a man cannot congruently ſaye, I truſt that I ſhall haue aduerſitie, but he muſt ſaye, I feare that I ſhall haue aduerſitie, and I hope that I ſhall haue proſperitie. This theyr opinion is falſe, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as albeit aduerſitie can not be deſired of carnall men, nor therefore be hoped for, bicauſe they account ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie to be a naughtie thing, yet notwithſtanding ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:3278:68"/>
men which know that aduerſitie is good, and the gifte of God, can both deſire and hope for it: ſo that a good Chriſtian maye congruentlye ſaye, I hope that GOD of his méere goodneſſe and grace, will giue mée aduerſitie, with graunting me patience: and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that hée will doe thus much fauour, that I maye ſpende my bloude for his glorye. Then ſéeing that Hope is nothing els but a godlye and ſpirituall deſire that wée haue of things for the glory of GOD, with a ſure and certayne expectation, that GOD for Chriſt and his méere goodneſſe, will giue them vs, foraſmuch as they ſhall bée to his glory, it is of neceſſitie, that this <hi>Hope</hi> can neuer bée confounded, but ſhall obtayne all things.</p>
               <p>And this, bicauſe that ſuch deſires and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all expectations, hauing not for foundation refuge and ende any other but GOD, it muſt néedes bee ſayed that they are of God: wherefore not vayne. GOD is hée that giueth mée that deſire, which béeing my guide I wiſh to haue thoſe things to the glorye of God.</p>
               <p>God alſo is hée which gouerning with his ſpirite, tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to mée in my hearte, witneſſeth vnto mée, and maketh mee ſure and certayne, that I ſhall obtayne at his hande: Wherefore inaſmuch as GOD can-not lye, hée that putteth his truſt in him can-not remayne with confuſion, or deceiued, ſo that his hope and truſte bée right and true, the which <hi>Hope,</hi> lyke as GOD giueth it not but to his elect, ſo alſo hée neuer graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vnto anye perſon habilytie to obtayne anye thing, but when it pleaſeth him to giue it.</p>
               <p>Wherefore <hi>Dauid</hi> ſayde: Saue mée O Lorde,<note place="margin">Pſal. 16</note> for I haue put my truſt in thée: as though hée had ſayde, Thou canſt not forſake them that commit themſelues to thy charge, and doe put their confidence in thée.</p>
               <p>And in an other place: Thoſe which put their truſt in

There was neuer any that hoped in the Lord and was confounded: and this bicauſe God neuer forſaketh them that truſt in him: <hi>Hope</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth neuer abide with confuſion or aſhamed. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt demaunding of his Apoſtles, if when he ſent them forth without wallet ſcrippe,<note place="margin">Luc. 22.</note> or ſhoes, they wanted any thing, and they aunſwering him no, he ſayde vnto them, now let him that hath a wallet ſel it and likewiſe his ſcrippe, and he that hath none, let him ſell his coate, and buy him a ſword: as if he would ſay, whileſt that you truſted in me, although you were poore and without any worldly thing, ye wanted nothing, but forbicauſe now you béeing offended at my death which is néere at hande, will diſtruſt of mée, therefore I ſay vnto you, buy you ſwords, &amp; defend your ſelues by your own ſtrength: and this, not to perſwade you to any confidence of your ſelues and of worldly things, but to diſdain the ſtrength of this world, and to ſhew that without the grace of God they be moſt vaine.

And moreouer the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ought not to be carefull (as Chriſt ſaid) in thinking and ſaying, what ſhall we eate, what ſhall we drinke, &amp; wherwith ſhall we be clothed, as the Gentiles do, which doe not beléeue that God hath care &amp; prouidence of them: not that a Chriſtian man ought not vſe due dilligence &amp; care in vſing his art, occupation, and buſineſſe, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in ſéeking by honeſt meanes to get his hire or due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and prouide him things neceſſary, yea, if in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd thinges they ſhall be negligent, ſuch negligence ſhal be vnto them a damnable thing, but now they néede not be vexed and carefull in thinking and fearinge that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they doe the foreſayd thinges, God will in anye wiſe fayle them: ſo that man ought of duetie to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in dooing that which belongeth vnto him to doe, but he ought not to be carefull in doubting that God would not doe all that which apperteyneeh vnto him.

ſuch, as honeſtly gather together that they may be the better able to prouide for the want of their neighbours, as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> did in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> foraſmuch as ſuch carefulnes groweth of charitie: but his purpoſe was onely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne and forbid the carefulneſſe of thoſe, which gather riches together for couetouſneſſe and a diſtruſt that they haue in God. So that a good chriſtian ought to doe that which is his duetie to doe, and then to be ſure &amp; certein that God will not forſake him: and ſo he ſhall liue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great griefe. And although a Chriſtian man doth not all that is his duetie, he ought not in any wiſe at any time fall from confidence in God, but to truſt &amp; ſay, albeit I am a wicked perſon, God is good, which wil help mée.<note place="margin">Iob. 13</note> And if I knew that God would not giue me rayment, yea, would take awaye all that I haue, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I with all my houſeholde muſt dye for hunger, I would in no wiſe ceaſe to truſt in him, bicauſe I know certeinly by fayth that he would do all for my benefit, with great charitie.

If Hope were grounded vpon our own works, men might of neceſſitie hope more or leſſe, according as they had done mo or fewer good woorks: but foraſmuch as our Hope ought to be founded onely vpon God, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both the good and bad, whileſt they are in this preſent lyfe ought to haue a lyke hope and that moſt perfect. And whereas the good by theyr ſpirituall &amp; holy workes, may and ought to take occaſion to thinke and beléeue that God loueeh them, ſéeing that he hath giuen them grace to doe ſuch good workes, &amp; thereby to thinke that they are the elect of God, and to hope for theyr ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, the wicked alſo by their ſinnes may take occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to truſt for ſaluation, inaſmuch as they may &amp; ought to beléeue, that God hath ſuffered them to fall, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that knowing the better theyr frailtie, ignorance, &amp; ſtubburneneſſe, with a more humble heart they may goe for helpe vnto God: and he may ſhew himſelfe vnto them with greater abundance of his grace. The lyke I ſaye concerning worldly thinges, he ought no leſſe to put his truſt in God which féeleth aduerſitie, then he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath proſperitie, foraſmuch as like as the firſt, by thoſe giftes that he hath receiued, ſéeing that God loueth him ought to hope for better, ſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſecond, ſéeing that by that aduerſitie, god giueth him ſo fit occaſion to exerciſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in al vertue, ought w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> eleuating his Hope, to thinke

that God loueth him moſt ſingulerly, and that he vſeth towardes him the ſame manner of tender care, that he was wont to vſe with his elect, and before time with his onely begotten ſonne. The elect therefore if they haue proſperitie and benefits of this preſent lyfe, they doe not put theyr confidence in them, knowinge that they bée moſt vaine ſhaddowes, giuen them by GOD for to rayſe them vppe to the conſideration of Gods di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine goodneſſe, and to make them the more ſteedefaſt v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon God with their Hope: and lykewiſe if they haue aduerſitie, as the true children of God, feeling a diuine loue in him, and that the LORDE doth giue them that aduerſitie for theyr benefite, they be ſo muche the more enforced to tourne them vnto GOD and to confirme their hope in him. Whereas the wicked, lyke as the more proſperitie they haue by GOD, ſo much the greater confidence they haue in him after a ſorte: ſo lykewiſe how much the more they are in try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations, ſo much the more, they thinking that hée is their enemie, doe abſent themſelues from him, with theyr Hope, and do diſtruſt in him.

And in the firſt is ſéene how much pitiful God is, ſéeing that when the firſt man had ſinned, and offended agaynſt god, he did not condemne him immediatly, as he iuſtly might haue done, yea for to heale the pride that was hidden in him, he forbad him that he ſhoulde not taſt the Apple: knowing that he would not obey him, although he threatened him death, to the intent that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>And beſides all this, ariſinge agayne, hée ſhewed himſelfe oftentimes vnto his electe, more amyable, godlye, and pacified, hée lightened them with diuine matters, with beſtowinge on them many gracious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites. Hee aſcended viſibly into heauen, that our hope
<pb facs="tcp:3278:73"/>
might be lifted vp on high, abiding therefore with his ſpirit vpon earth. He ſent the holy ghoſt vpon his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, viſibly at the day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> like as he ſent it vnto his alwaies inuiſibly.

There is no man y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> can deuiſe greater mercy then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which God hath vſed with vs. Séeing that we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him he ſhould haue vſed great mercy with vs, if he ſhould but once haue had remembraunce of vs, but that he ſent not a ſeruant, but his ſonne, to heale our ſicknes with his own bloud, yea, &amp; toke our infirmitie vpon him. &amp; ſuffered y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which of duetie we ought to haue ſuffered, this was a very great mercifulnes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> after ſinne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, hath ſaued <hi>Adam</hi> &amp; all his poſteritie.

The ſin of <hi>Dauid</hi> was great, &amp; therefore with his heart he ſayd, I haue ſinned, and immediately he was pardoned.

not only when he chaſtiſeth vs, but alſo when he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth vs to fall into any ſinne. He ſuffered (as <hi>Paul</hi> did write) euen the <hi>Iewes</hi> to fall, that he might ſaue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. Hauing then to bring vs vnto the mercye of god, one ſo mighty &amp; pitifull, an high Prieſt, as Chriſt is, who preuenteth vs with his mercye, we ought in him put all our hope, and foraſmuch as he hath already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered vs from all ſinnes, therefore alſo from all miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. He as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> the Patriarch, although he had bene hurt by his brethren, could not in any wiſe refrain, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> with his mercy he would embrace vs. He alone was that <hi>Samaritane,</hi> who truely had pitie vpon vs. He alſo hath bene, and is that diuine ſhephearde, which came downe from heauen for his loſt flocke.</p>
               <p>He together with the father of the prodigall ſonne, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth &amp; embraceth with great ioy the miſerable ſinner, when he humbly turneth vnto him. He without béeing many times requeſted, rayſeth againe the dead ſonne of the Church militant, as before time he rayſed vp the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes ſonne.

               <p>Chriſt regarded him with the eye of his pittie, and therefore hée was ſaued.

He craued that he might lyue in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce and Chriſt promiſed him Heauen, ſaying, Verily I ſay vnto thée, that this day thou ſhalt be with me in <hi>Paradice.</hi> He added vnto the promiſe, this worde verily, to the intent that he might be aſſured thereoff: as if he would ſay, be aſſured, that thou ſhalt be with me in Heauen as thou art with me on the Croſſe. He reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to be in his remembraunce, and Chriſt promiſed him <hi>Paradice:</hi> and when ſhould he be there? the very ſame day: and with what company? with Chriſt: and howe long? for euer: and to whom did he promiſe ſuch great treaſures? to a moſt vyle théefe, who for his wickedneſſe was hanged vppon the Croſſe: and wherfore did he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe him ſuch a benefite? not for anye merites of the Théefe, but for his owne merites, and thorough méere grace.

lulled a ſléepe vnder the ſhaddow of the lawe, had néede of a ſinguler calling for to be awaked, and to the intent that he might open his eyes vnto Chriſt He ſayd then vnto him, why perſecuteſt thou mée? knoweſt thou not that thou perſecuteſt one who neuer offended thée? one that is thy friende, one that for thee came downe from Heauen, one that dyed for thée vpon the Croſſe, &amp; would dye a thouſand times, if it were ſo expedient, perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt thou one ſo déere a friende of thine, that albeit thou haſt offended him moſt highly, yet notwithſtandinge, without any thy forwarde diſpoſition, doth not onelye pardon thee, but hath elected thée for one of his principal Capitaynes? Then <hi>Paul</hi> ſayde, who art thou Lorde? as if he ſhould ſay, I perceiue a voyce, I heare woordes, I féele that one talketh with mée, but I cannot tell who it is.

Then Chriſt aunſwered and ſayde: I am Ieſus, whome thou perſecuteſt, with attributinge to himſelfe all the hurt that was done to his elect. As if he woulde ſaye, reade my Goſpell, conſider all my lyfe, and thou ſhalt finde that it hath bene continuallye and alwayes, full of reproches, infamyes, labours, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions and croſſes, and for al this thou ſhalt not finde that euer I did lament mine eſtate: but foraſmuch as thou perſecuteſt mine elect, whiche beeing ſoule of my ſoule, and heart of my heart, are to me more déere then mine owne lyfe, I cannot abide that thou ſhouldeſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute them.

Then <hi>Paul</hi> béeing by this time altogether inwardly chaunged, diſpoſing himſelfe to the good will of God, ſayde: Lorde what wilt thou that I ſhould doe? as if he ſhould ſaye, I commit my ſelfe wholly into thy handes, doe with me what it pleaſeth thée. O happie ſicke man, ſéeinge that he committed himſelfe into the charge of one ſo expert, able, and louing a Phiſitian. O happie loſt flocke, ſeeing it is now fallen into the pitifull armes of the heauenly ſhephearde: Chriſt ſayd then: ariſe vp and goe into the citie, and there it ſhall be tolde thée what thou oughteſt to do. Thoſe which were in his company, ſtoode aſtony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hearing the voyce, although they vnderſtoode not the worde, and ſéeinge nothing.

And likewiſe Chriſt made of him a glorious and diuine conqueſt, inaſmuch as where he went to attach the elect of God, he himſelfe was attached of Chriſt. He woulde

His conuerſion alſo was wonderfull, not onely bicauſe Chriſt ſtayed him on a ſodain from ſo great an anger &amp; violence, with which he went to the diſhonour of God: but moreouer conuerted him, turned and drew him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, with great force: ſo that he conducted him to the top &amp; height of all vertues, in ſuch ſort that concerning his following of Chriſt, he ſayd: Be ye like vnto me, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Chriſt. I know not who could more haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed the world &amp; his owne righteouſneſſe, ſéeing that he accounted for dounge, euery thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was without Chriſt. Who is it that hath for Chriſt ſo deſpiſed this preſent life, as <hi>Paul</hi> did? who ſayd, I deſire to be diſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and to be with Chriſt. And as concerning mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the olde <hi>Adam,</hi> he ſaid, I chaſtiſe my body and bring it in ſubiection. He was crucified w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſt, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſayd, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſt I am nailed vpon the croſſe. Ther was none of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Saints y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> tooke ſo much paines for Chriſt as he did: he himſelfe writing to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſayd, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had laboured more abu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dantly, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other Apoſtles.

His glorious Enſignes, were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> markes of Ieſus Chriſt, which he beare in his body. And his glorye was the witneſſe, not of men, but of the holy Ghoſt, and of his owne conſcience.

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:3278:79"/>Writing his Epiſtles &amp; béeing willing to giue autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to his word, he called himſelfe moſt often <hi>Paul</hi> in bondes for Chriſt, adiudging himſelfe greater, when hee was impriſoned for Chriſt, then if he had bene in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt high throne and ſeate of dignitie in the world. His fayth was certeyne, wherefore he ſayde, I runne not as to an vncerteyne thing, his hope was ſtedfaſt, wherefore he ſayde, we are made ſafe thorough hope: and his charitie was perfect, therefore he ſayd, who ſhal ſeperate me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the loue of God? he had ſuch zeale and loue of ſoules for the honour of God, that he deſired to be accurſed from Chriſt, for the glory of God and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaluation of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. He was euer fixed with his heart and minde in heauen, wherefore he ſayd, our conuerſation is in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And for all this he was ſo humble, that he called himſelfe the leaſt of the Apoſtles, vnworthy the name of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, borne out of due ſeaſon, and nothing, yea, the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt ſinner of the world. <hi>Paul</hi> was a ſpirituall temple of God, in which he wrought wonderfull things. And what néede I ſay more, he was an inſtrument of Chriſt, and a veſſell elected to publiſh all abroade the name of Ieſus, &amp; to ſuffer for him.

Let vs ſet this glaſſe before our eyes, not onely to the intent that we may neuer diſpayre, but alſo, ſo that following him in all good thinges, we may render vnto God all prayſe, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glorye, thorough Ieſus Chriſt our Lorde. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <head>¶What thing it is to loue God. Sermon. I.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here be ſome who forbicauſe they ſaye that they loue God, doe thinke that they loue him ſufficiently, but God is lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with the heart, not with wordes. To loue God is an other manner of thing then onely to ſay, I loue GOD. Some other bicauſe they faſt, giue almes, praye, and doe lyke workes, doe thinke that the dooing thereoff is a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of God. But loue conſiſteth in the heart, not in the handes, albeit by the workes, it is declared &amp; made knowne. Such outwarde woorkes may be done by hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, and by ſuch as be not in loue with God: and when they are done alſo by thoſe which loue God, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, albeit thoſe outward workes do grow of loue, they are not therefore loue it ſelfe, but the effects theroff. Alſo thoſe be deceyued which bicauſe when they talke haue a féeling of that they talke, when they read or meditate on any deuout thing, haue a certeine taſt, and doe feele a certeine pleaſaunt ſwéetneſſe therein, doo beléeue that the hauing of ſuch lyke taſt and féelinge, is the louing of God: but foraſmuch as ſuch like pleaſure and taſting, is many times graunted, not onely to the vnperfect, but alſo to the wicked, the which be not in loue with God: therefore ſuch ſenſuall appetites and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, be effects of the fleſh, and not of the ſpirit. It is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-true, that they which loue God truely, for that they féele with the ſpirite that they be of the elect, that God loueth them, that he is theyr Father, and that he hath a ſinguler care of them, wherefore they haue in theyr heartes as it were alwayes, a certeine ioyfulneſſe, but ſincere and pure: they take pleaſure to reaſon of God, to
<pb facs="tcp:3278:80"/>
heare his worde, to read the holy Scriptures, to behold his diuine goodneſſe, and to pray &amp; do other good works, yet notwithſtanding this pleaſure is not loue it ſelfe, but the effect of loue. To iudge God of greateſt price, to eſtéeme him, to account him déere, to ſet more by him then by all the worlde, and himſelfe, they all be effectes of loue, but not loue it ſelfe. And ſo likewiſe, although y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue of god, making vs of no reputation in our ſelues, tranſformeth vs in God, and that in ſuch ſort, that eſtée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming nothing good but God, we account our ſelues and all other things nothing worth, except in that that they may ſerue to the glory of God, notwithſtanding this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting our ſelues, and tranſforming in God, be not loue it ſelfe, but the effectes of loue. Alſo thoſe doe deceiue themſelues, which for that they haue a deſire to goe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heauen, for theyr owne felicitie and profite, doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue that this deſire is the louing of God, and in verye truth it is but an effect of ſelfe loue, contrary to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue of God. It is very true, that the deſire of going to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for the glory of god, is no effect of ſelfe loue, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the very loue of god, but an effect thereoff. Lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe alſo to loue God bicauſe he hath giuen to thée, gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to thée, or bicauſe thou hopeſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he will giue to thée ryches, children, honours, pleaſures, and other bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites, is in truth no louing of God, but of thy ſelfe. And in like ſort alſo, foraſmuch as GOD hath plentifully all benefites, therefore ſéeing that in himſelfe cannot deſire any good thing, if the louing of god were to deſire any good thing in him, God coulde not be loued. It is very true, that we may and ought to deſire it, not that GOD is more glorious in himſelfe, bicauſe this is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, but that he is more glorious vnto the worlde, with his glory by creatures, béeing made manifeſt and famous. But this deſire is not the louing of GOD it ſelfe, but and effect thereoff. Neyther is it the louing
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:3278:80"/>
of God to be gladde and reioyce together of his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite, bicauſe that all this groweth of the loue which we beare him but it is not loue it ſelfe. Loue is a thing much dearer vnto vs. And ſo alſo the loue of GOD is not that liuelye and ſpirituall, knowledge, taſte, and feeling, that we haue of GOD, yea loue groweth of it ſelfe, inaſmuch as, for that lyuely with the ſpirite wee doe féele his goodneſſe, therefore we doe loue him.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it is to bée noted that loue is a thing ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to vs, that albeit we do loue, yet notwithſtanding we knowe with great difficulty what loue is, and with greater difficultie can we expreſſe it. So that lyke as it is an eaſie thinge to knowe that GOD is, but verye harde to diſcerne what manner of one he is: ſo it is eaſie to loue, and to knowe that loue is, but to vnderſtande and expreſſe what manner of thing it is, that is a moſt harde matter. And for all this I thinke to expreſſe it. Loue is nothinge els but a certeyne inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which we haue to hinges. Lyke as the naturall loue is none other but a naturall inclynation, whiche all creatures haue vnto theyr owne béeing, whereoff it groweth that they naturally haue a longinge after, doe deſire, and are moued to ſéeke all thoſe thinges which do preſerue it.</p>
               <p>In lyke ſorte ſenſuall loue is an inclynation which all lyuinge ſenſible creatures haue vnto pleaſure, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it groweth that they deſire and bée moued to ſéeke for thoſe thinges which woulde cauſe it, as meate, and other things whereoff pleaſure groweth. And lykewiſe humane &amp; reaſonable loue, is nothing els but an incly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation which men haue vnto honeſtye, whereoff it groweth that they deſire and be moued to ſéeke for ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, be pleaſed and delyghted therein.</p>
               <p>Nowe the true and ſpirituall loue of GOD is nothinge elſe but a ſpirytuall inclynation whiche the Sayntes haue vnto the glorye of GOD,
<pb facs="tcp:3278:81"/>
the which groweth of a liuely feeling that they haue of the goodneſſe of God, &amp; of this inclynation groweth that they long for and deſire to honour him, and that hée maye bée honoured of all creatures. They are moued to honour him in ſuch ſorte as they can, and doe ſéeke that he may bée alſo honoured of others, and ſo they come to ſhewe foorth actes of loue, they reioyce together and bée delyghted in all thoſe thinges which make to the glorye of God, wherefore they take pleaſure in all the good workes that bée done, and lykewiſe alſo doe ſéeke to haue euery day more light of the goodneſſe of God. But it is to be vnderſtoode, that ſéeing ſuch incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is altogether ſpirituall, it is not found in carnall men, but only in thoſe, who béeing regenerated thorough Chriſt, be ſpirituall, wherefore they alone do loue God in truth, thoſe which are by hauing fayth borne agayn, thoſe the more, which haue the greater fayth. And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as God, as he that hath in himſelfe the fulneſſe of all perfection, hath no inclination to creatures, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he loueth them not in ſuch ſorte as he is loued of vs, yea, the loue which GOD beareth to creatures, is none other but a willingneſſe to doe them good effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, for as longe time as he thinketh good. But let vs praye vnto the Lord that hée woulde make vs féele his loue, to the intent that we may render to him all praiſe, honour, and glorye, thorough Ieſus Chriſt our Lorde, Amen.</p>

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:3278:81"/>
be loued. In him alone is the true beautie, by the which things are loued, the true <hi>Charitie,</hi> wiſedome, mercy, and all other vertues, which can moue &amp; ſtirre vs vp to loue: inaſmuch as the vertues that be ſound in creatures, and likewiſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beautie, are no true vertues nor true beautie, but ſhadowes a farre off, and Images of the vertues &amp; beautie of God: yea God alone is he, who is in truth, wherefore he onely ought to be loued. Creatures haue not any true beeing, but ſhadowed, wherefore God ſayd vnto <hi>Moſes,</hi> I am: as if he would ſaye, Goe downe vnto <hi>Aegypt</hi> to deliuer my people without feare, for that creatures bicauſe they haue no true being, they can-not without me doe thée any hurt nor yet helpe thée, but I alone am he, who for that I am in truth, can doe thée both good and euill. And although when we bée loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that loue procureth vs to loue them againe which loue vs yet bicauſe we be not loued in truth of any but onely of God, from whome alone we muſt acknowledge to haue all our beatitude, therefore him onely we ought to loue. Wherefore as God is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt beginning of al our beatitude, ſo alſo he ought to be our laſt end, vnt who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ought to goe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al our loue, with which in him alone we ought to ſtabliſh our ſelues: as he himſelfe commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſaying. Thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, ſoule, minde, ſtrength, and vertue. Therefore God willing to haue of vs all loue, as is conuenient he ſhould, layeth hard to our charge, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ought not in any wiſe giue part therof to creatures. Thou wilt ſaye God hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we loue our neighbour as our ſelues, wherefore we ought not to loue God alone, but alſo cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures. I aunſwere and ſay that Chriſt ſayd alſo, that he which hateth not father &amp; mother, children, brothers, ſiſters, and moreouer himſelfe, can-not be my Diſciple: and how ſhall it be poſſible that we hate them, and on the other ſide, being our neighbours, that we loue them as our ſelues, ſéeing that hatred is contrary to loue?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:3278:82"/>For the vnderſtanding therefore of the truth, it is to wit, that nothing in truth is loued, but onely that thing in which loue is ſtedfaſtly fixed and ſet: and in lyke ſort there is in truth no hatred, but onely that, in which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred is fixed and bounded: and bicauſe that like as the waters runne all into the Sea, neither doe they euer reſt vntill they come thether, ſo God, for that he alone is in truth good, our firſt beginning and laſt ende, our loue paſſing by creatures, ought not to be ſtayd in them, but wholly to be directed euen vnto God, and to reſt in him: wherefore he alone in truth ought to be loued. And likewiſe alſo, foraſmuch as ſinne onelye is in trueth naught and filthie, therefore it alone ought to be hated: ſo that albeit our hatred paſſe by creatures, it ought ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore not to be ſtayd in them, but to be directed vnto wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, and there onely to reſt. And to vnderſtand this the better, I will bring an example of a perfect Chriſtian. whoſe heart if thou ſaweſt, thou ſhouldeſt ſee that his loue is wholly vppon God: and yet for all this, hée lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth creatures, with-out ſtaying therefore his loue in them, yea he loueth them not, but for the glory of God, &amp; inaſmuch as they ſerue to make it manifeſt: ſo that ſuch a one might ſay vnto God the ſame wordes that <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> ſayde in time paſſed, O Lord when I loue and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I loue not that creature, but thée, for whoſe loue I loue it. Although the ſpouſe, doth loue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gifts of hir huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, ſhe doth not therefore ſtaye hir ſelfe with hir loue vpon them, but onely doth loue them for his ſake y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> gaue them, and bicauſe they ſerue for his glory and credit: in lyke ſort the true ſpouſe of the Sonne of God, doth not loue, account precious, nor eſtéeme the benefites of God for the worthineſſe of them onelye, nor yet for hir owne gayne, but only for being giuen of God, and for that they ſerue to his glory. Likewiſe alſo a good Chriſtian hateth no perſons, but for their wickedneſſe, which be to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of God, béeing by him moſt highly loued, ſo that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:3278:82"/>
his hatred is not fixed in the creature but in the ſinne.</p>
               <p>We ought therefore to loue God with all our heart, and that with ſtaying our ſelues with al our hopes vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him: and we ought to loue our neighbors as our ſelues, with out ſtabliſhing in any wiſe our loue vppon them, but w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> louing them onely for the glory of God, and inaſmuch as they ſerue to the making of it manifeſt. We ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to hate our neighbours, our parents, and our ſelues, as Chriſt ſayde, not with ſtaying our ſelues with hatred towardes them, but towardes their vices and ſinnes: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as we ought to hate them onely, for that they béeing carnall doe hinder vs, draw vs backe, make vs ſlacke, &amp; ſuffer not vs to make famous the glory of God. Like as then there is one onely God, ſo he alone ought to be loued: and as al other things be of God, ſo onely for him they ought to be loued. Al the creatures together be not worthy of our loue, which is fit for none but God. And al this of our loue which reſteth in creatures, is loſt. God as he who is iealous ouer vs, will haue all our loue for himſelf: of other things that we haue he is content that we ſhould communicate &amp; giue vnto others, ſo that it be to his glory, but loue he would not, that ſhould giue vnto any but him. If we loue men, for that they be our kinſfolkes, be lyke vnto vs, and come of the ſame bloud that we doe, ſuch loue is naturall and not vertuous.</p>
               <p>If we loue them for their beautie, and there-in doe eſtabliſh our ſelues with our loue, in ſuch a caſe that is a laſciuious loue. If we loue them for profite, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céedeth of couetouſneſſe: if for dignitie or honour which we looke to obtaine, that loue commeth of pride: If alſo we loue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for that we hope that they ſhall ſerue for our ſaluation, and for that we truſt by their meanes to goe vnto Heauen, which we deſire onely for our owne felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, without hauing reſpect to the glory of GOD, this alſo is wholly a wicked and carnall loue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:3278:83"/>But now this truely is a loue, bright, ſincere, pure, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and of <hi>Charitie,</hi> when we loue our ſelues &amp; crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, onely for the glory of God, and onely when they doe ſerue, or be to ſerue to the manifeſting thereoff.</p>
               <p>True <hi>Charitie</hi> then, as <hi>Paule</hi> did write, ſéeketh not the things that be our own, but the glorye of God: yea it is a vertue that is moſt worthy, moſt high, moſt pure, and altogether diuine, holdeth the eyes alwayes open, ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt and fixed on the glory of God, and albeit ſometimes, as that which is moſt pitifull and humble, it debaſeth it ſelfe, to helpe the neighbours, it is not therefore ſtayed in them, but immediately with exalting it ſelfe on high, it returneth to the glory of God: yea, for that <hi>Charitie</hi> maketh vs of no reputation in our ſelues, and tranſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vs in God, therefore it maketh that not ſéeing vs any more in our ſelues, but onely in GOD, we cannot any more loue vs in our ſelues but in God alone.

Crowne thereoff, and this alone he payed thée, tell mée in ſuch a caſe, albeit he could not pay thée the thouſande Crownes, ſhould this be for this that he was not bound to paye thée them? ſurely no, but he ſhould remaine and be in any wiſe bound, albeit he could not then pay them. And that the truth is ſo, is moſt certeine, inaſmuch as if one ſhould euer become rich, he ſhould be bound to giue them thée, not by any new Obligacion, but by that olde, the which did alwayes continue, and was neuer cancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, albeit it hath lyen hidden for that time, in which he was not able to pay them, wherefore thou oughteſt not to cauſe him to be caſt in priſon, ſéeing that he could not pay them, and that it was with-out his fault: ſo lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if we cannot render vnto God infinite loue, but onely a very little, for this cauſe, not that we are not bound thereto, ſo that if it were poſſible that God ſhould make vs ſo perfect, that we might loue him with an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite loue, we ſhould be bound to loue him infinitely, and not by any new Oblygacion, but by the olde which laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth euer. It is very true that it lyeth hidden, ſéeing that we be not able to loue him with an infinite loue: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore although we doe not loue him with ſuch great loue, hée will not for this caſte vs into the priſon of Hell: ſo that we loue him as much as we are able. And if thou wouldeſt ſay, that God hath diſpenſed and vnbounde vs of this Bonde of louing him with an infinite loue, ſéeing that we are not able to obſerue it. I will ſay, that if this our Bonde depended onely on his diuine will, he might diſpence with vs and vnbinde vs, but it dependeth on his infinite goodneſſe, wherefore lyke as God can-not take away any thing from his infinite goodneſſe, and yet bée infinitely good, ſo he cannot vnbinde vs, that wée ſhould not be alwayes bounde to loue him with infinite loue, as is fit for his infinite goodneſſe, and is our duetie, to doe although we cannot. And héere it may be ſéene, not onely howe great the goodneſſe of God is, ſéeing that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:3278:84"/>
whereas an infinite loue is due vnto him, he is conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a ſmall loue, but alſo how great our imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, ſéeing that infinitely we doe faile of doing that which is conuenient for vs to doe vnto GOD. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit God doth not impute vnto vs ſuch a defect and ſinne, neither doth he puniſh vs therefore, ſéeing that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not loue him, as much as for him ſhould be conuenient. But thou wilt ſay, I would know with how great loue I am bound to loue God, ſo that in me there may be no fault vnto me imputed, and ſo I might be damned. I aunſwere that we are bound to loue him with all our heart, ſoule, and minde, neither can it be ſayde, that God in ſaying, Thou ſhalt loue God with all thy heart, ſoule and minde, did not commaund that we ſhould loue him whileſt that we are in this preſent lyfe with ſo great a loue, but that he would onely ſhewe vs what we ſhould doe when we ſhall be in Heauen, as ſome haue ſaid héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, inaſmuch as Chriſt ſayde contrariwiſe, that this was not onely a commaundement but the chiefeſt. Nor yet can it be ſayd as the Papiſtes ſay, that to fulfill and obſerue this commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, it is ſufficient that we giue vnto God one part of our loue, ſo that it be the greateſt part: and that we loue God alone, more then all other things, and this firſt, bicauſe God is of the contrary wil in commaunding vs that we ſhould giue all our hearte and therby all our loue: the which alſo he repeated with many wordes, diuers wayes, to the intent y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ſhould be inexcuſable. And to expound, thou ſhalt loue God w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all thy heart, that is with parte, is not to declare the worde of God, but to depraue it, and to gainſay it. For that they haue againſt them, <hi>Baſil, Origene, Auguſtine, Bernard, Gregory, Nicene, Hugo de ſanto vittore,</hi> &amp; many other holy men, all the which notwithſtanding with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers words in expounding this commaundement, haue ſayde, that we are bounde to giue vnto GOD all our loue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:3278:85"/>Thou wilt ſay, if it be ſo, we muſt be all damned, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as there is no body, which giueth to God all his loue, yea whileſt that we be in this preſent life, without a ſingular priuiledge, we cannot doe it, for that ſince the ſinne of our firſt parents, thorough the concupiſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that be in vs, we be hindered and ſlacked from the loue of God, and in ſuch ſort, that we do neuer loue him with all our loue, yea ſome parte of our loue doeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes abide in the earth.

And if thou wouldeſt demaunde when we are bound to loue him ſo, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes do ſay, with deceiuing therefore themſelues and others, and ſay, that the commaundements negatiue do binde vs alwayes, and for all times, but the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes affirmatiue doe binde alwayes, but not for all times. As for example: for that not to ſteale is a commaundement negatiue, we be alwayes bound with this commaundement, and moreouer bound to obſerue it thorough euery moment of time, ſo that it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for vs at any time to ſteale. But on the other ſide, foraſmuch as the dooing of almes is a commaundement affirmatiue, therefore albeit we be neuer frée from this

precept, but are alwayes bound to obſerue it, we be not therefore bounde to obſerue it thorough all times: foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much we are not bounde to giue almes at all times, and continually, but onely at certeyne times, that is, when we be able, and ſée our neighbours in néede. Now they ſaye lykewiſe, that ſéeing not to hate GOD, is a a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement negatiue, it bindeth vs alwayes, and thorough all times, in ſuch ſort, that continually and for euer it ſhall not be lawfull, by any moment of time to hate him, but foraſmuch as to loue God is a commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement affirmatiue, therefore albeit we ſhall neuer bée vnbounde from this commaundement, we ſhall not bée therefore bounde to obſerue it thorough euery moment of time, but onely when it ſhall bée néedefull.

But firſt, whereas they ſaye, that we are bound to loue God onely when it is néedful, I would that they would tell me what they meane by this ſaying to be néedful. If they meane that lyke as we are not bounde to giue almes, but when our neighbours haue néede thereoff, ſo that we be not bound to loue God, but when God hath néede of our loue, it is certeine that we ſhould neuer be bound to loue him, ſéeing that God ſhal neuer haue néede of vs, nor of our loue.

And I ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as God is alwayes moſt perfectly good, pitifull, righteous, wiſe, omnipotent, and moſt excellent, therfore he ought of vs to be moſt perfectly loued alwayes.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding we are bound alwayes &amp; thorough all times to loue them inwardly. In like ſort alſo, albeit we are not

bound alwayes to praiſe GOD with voyce, but onely when it ſhould be expedient for to ſtirre vp our ſelues or others to giue glory vnto God, yet notwithſtanding we are bound to loue God alwayes &amp; continually with all our heart. We ought alſo, not only on the Sundayes &amp; holydayes, but al the time of our life, &amp; euery moment thereoff, ſanctifie him, with making him ſhine in honour of his maieſtie, foraſmuch as to this ende onelye it is graunted vs from God. Neither is it without iniurye done vnto him when we faile of that high &amp; perfect loue which is fit for him. And although y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whilſt we be in this preſent lyfe, without a ſinguler priuiledge &amp; grace wée cannot loue God continually, as alſo we cannot loue him with all our heart, ſoule, &amp; minde, notwithſtanding for this cauſe it is not fully ſet downe, neyther can it be ſayd, that ſuch loue is not conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for God, nor our duety to doe.

Peraduenture thou wilt ſay, if that a valiant Citizen doth hazard his owne life for his country, with out any other grace or light ſupernaturall, yea and the hand doth offer it ſelfe for the ſauegard of the head, as is oftentimes ſéene by experience: and thereby if a politike man, without any other grace can loue his country more then himſelfe, and likewiſe alſo the hande doth manye times loue the head better then it ſelfe, we haue cauſe to thinke and beléeue, that our wil may ſo much more then the foreſayd things loue God more then it ſelfe, as that God is more greater then the head or the countrey. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this alſo I aunſwere and ſay, that a valiant Citizen doth hazard his life many times for glory which hée lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth more then his own life, or it is true, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he foreſéeing, that looſing his countrey, he ſhould looſe all that he hath, therefore he adiudgeth it be leſſe hurte in ſuch a caſe to ſpende his life. Some other be moued to take armour vppon them for the profites ſake which they hope to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, or els for the loſſe which they feare will happen.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:3278:90"/>All this then that a polytike man doth as one that is carnall, is onely for himſelfe, and for his owne proper gaine. And likewiſe alſo a man when he offereth his hande contrarye to the proper inclination, to receiue a wound for the ſafegard of the head, doth it, bicauſe hée loueth himſelfe, and ſéeth that it would be ſmaller hurt &amp; leſſe daunger, if he ſuffer his hande to be hurt, then if he ſuffer his head. It is alwayes then ſelfe-loue, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vs to doe anye thing, when wée bee with-out diuine grace. And albeit that God alone in truth is good, and includeth in him al vertues, &amp; being al goodneſſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not onely we ought to loue him aboue all other things, but in him alone we ought to ſtay our loue, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding thorough the ſinne of our firſt parents, we be ſo blinde, féeble, miſchieuous and miſerable, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his grace and light ſupernaturall, not only we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſet our whole loue vpon him, no nor yet loue him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all other things. Thou wilt ſay, I proue yet, that although I be wicked, and without diuine grace, I haue notwithſtanding a certeine deſire to loue him, aboue all other things: and foraſmuch as this deſire is nothing els but loue, therefore it maye loue him aboue all cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out any other grace. Vnto this I ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if thou ſhalt go forward ſéeking diligently, thou ſhalt finde that this deſire which thou haſt to loue him, is none other but for thine owne lucre. If thou be carnall, thou doeſt not deſire to loue him for his glory, but for thine owne feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and this is not to loue God, but thy ſelfe. And if thou wouldeſt ſay, I deſire that all my will, loue &amp; deſire may be moſt entire and ſincere. I aunſwere likewiſe and ſay, that this thy deſire alſo, if thou be carnall, is onely for regard of thy ſelfe, wherefore thou loueſt none but thy ſelfe. Whileſt therefore we be carnall, and that ſelf-loue doth raigne in vs, not onely we cannot loue God aboue all things, but we cannot in truth loue him, but for our owne gaine: the which is not to loue him but our ſelues.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:3278:90"/>
Thou wilt ſay, it is ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that diuine grace being our guyde, we may loue him as much as we would, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as diuine grace doth neuer faile, therefore it is alwayes in our power io loue him, and that in what ſorte it pleaſeth vs. Vnto this alſo I aunſwere and ſay, that there is experience to the contrarye, inaſmuch as men doe not loue God as much as they would, yea al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the reprobate ſhoulde vſe all their witte and ſtrength, they could in no wiſe loue him. It muſt néedes therefore be ſayd, that this grace of louing him, is not graunted alwayes, nor to all men, nor yet to loue him after our faſhion: yea the elect themſelues haue not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes this grace to be able to loue him, at their inſtance, nor in ſuch ſort as they ought: wherefore like as Faith is giuen of God, ſo alſo is <hi>Charitie.</hi> And they deceyue themſelues who thinking to haue alwayes in them po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to loue God, driue off to repent and conuert vnto the latter ende of their life.

Some ſay that the greateſt ſigne of loue which God hath ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto man, was when he created him after his own ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude and likeneſſe, capable of him, and to beatitude.

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:3278:95"/>The ieſtures alſo doe helpe when they be fitly applyed vnto the wordes to moue greatly, wherfore when a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would haue hir young ſonne come vnto hir, ſhe doth not onely call him, but alſo proueth him the more with beckening hir head, and with opening hir armes. The which Chriſt alſo did for to drawe vs vnto him: foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he ſtretched out his armes vpon the croſſe, as if he would ſay, beholde that I open and offer my ſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all men, ready and prepared to receiue and imbrace euery ſinner, which by my meane doth thirſt for his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Or if thou haddeſt ſeene with what &amp; how great firy teares, burning ſighes, and excéeding loue, he lifted vp his eyes to heauen to pray for vs, &amp; with what ſweete pitie he debaſed himſelfe and behelde thoſe which hadde nayled him on the croſſe, and others who were preſent, if thy heart were a thouſand times harder then an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damant</hi> ſtone, thou ſhouldeſt in any wiſe haue bene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned, that it ſhould not onely be mollyfied, made fée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and pleaſaunt, but moulten: chiefly, ſéeing that for thy loue bloud guiſhed out from euery part of him. And if the wiſdome of <hi>Salomon</hi> could worke ſo much in the Queene of <hi>Sabba,</hi> that with cauſing hir to leaue hir rich and delicate kingdom, drewe hir from ſo farre a country to trauaile euen to his preſence for to heare him, the wiſedome of Chriſt excéedingly ſhewed vpon the Croſſe, ought ſo much the more effectuallly drawe vs from the world vnto him, as that his is the greater without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion. Wherefore alſo in Chriſt vpon the Croſſe are fulfilled al the Prophets, are verified al the Scriptures, all ſhadowes and figures are made manifeſt, and all the treaſures of the wiſdome and knowledge of GOD are opened, wherefore as the moſt high, perfect, open, and manifeſt truth, he draweth our mindes to beholde it in him. And lykewiſe alſo for that lybertie, eſpecially of riches, is moſt effectual in alluring, chiefly the poore, and ſuch as be in neceſſitie therefore Chriſt for to draw vs
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:3278:95"/>
vnto him, vſed towardes vs vpon the croſſe a moſt hygh and excéeding liberalitie: foraſmuch as by meere grace, he not onely deliuered vs from ſinne, from the power of the diuell, and from all euill of this preſent life and of the lyfe to come, with making ſatiſfaction for all our bonds, but alſo moreouer giueth vs all his diuine trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, heauen and himſelfe. Yea, he draweth vs to hym euen with his righteouſneſſe, inaſmuch as we be draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and moued to haue compaſſion on him, ſeeing that in him, although he be moſt innocent, the Father with moſt rigorous iuſtice puniſheth all our ſinnes. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wythſtandinge, albeit vppon the croſſe he ſtirreth vs vp with wordes, prouoketh vs with his déedes, and diuine ieſtures, calleth vs with his wiſedome, moueth vs wyth his truth and bindeth vs with his benefites, draweth vs with his Charitie vnto him, with forcinge vs violently. Neyther ought any bodye to wonder héereat, foraſmuch as GOD béeing not onely the firſt beginning of all things, but alſo the laſt ende, and this bicauſe that lyke as all thinges depende on him, ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo they wayte vppon him, it muſt néede bée ſayde that hée vpholdeth them all, moueth and gouerneth them, not onely as theyr firſt efficient cauſe, but alſo as their laſt ende. And foraſmuch as the finall mocion, béeinge voluntary and louing, is more ſwift and forcible, then the motion of the efficient cauſe, agaynſt the whiche, whileſt that it pricketh vs, we repugne and reſiſt:</p>
               <p>Therefore GOD béeing willing to cauſe man that he ſhoulde come vnto him, he choſe not onely to moue vs with our firſt beginning, with impulſion of his ſpirite, but alſo wyth our laſt ende, hée woulde drawe vs vnto him by the meane of Chriſt crucified. Wherefore if the celeſtyall bodyes bée moued with ſo great force by the Angells, by what force and violence maye wée thinke that the noble ſpirites of the elect of GOD hée moued, when as béeing regenerated, looſed from the affections
<pb facs="tcp:3278:96"/>
of creatures, béeinge actiue and liuely, are not onelye driuen by the holy Ghoſt, but drawen with great vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence by CHRIT crucified. And if thou wouldeſt ſée how great the force of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue ſhewed to vs in Chriſt vppon the Croſſe is, conſider that if in the earth there were a man moſt ſenſuall, with all his affections moſte ſtricktly bounde vnto treaſures, pleaſures, honours, and benefites of the worlde, if in any wiſe it ſhould bée graunted vnto him to open his eyes but for very ſhort time to Chriſt vpon the Croſſe, to ſée him with a lyuely light, and to féele him with the ſpirite, that he was ſo crucified for him, he ſhould be by his loue in ſuche ſorte rauiſhed in the inwarde partes of his heart, and with ſuch violence and force drawen, that ſhaking in péeces all the fetters wherewith he was bounde vnto world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thinges, he ſhould immediatly be found with all his heart, ſoule, minde, and ſpirite eleuated, rauiſhed, and tranſformed in God. And héereoff we haue example in <hi>Paul,</hi> who whileſt that hée had tourned his ſhoulders againſt Chriſt, &amp; whileſt that with great force he ran to ſéeke the diſhonour of God, béeinge called and illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Chriſt, was drawen with ſuche violence to the glory of God, that he was rauiſhed vp euen to the third heauen. And albeit that afore time euen vntill his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion, he had bene moſt vehement agaynſt Chriſt, yet béeing conuerted, he was drawen to honour him with a greater vehemencie, inaſmuch as CHRIST was to hym more effectuall, then all other obiects which had before time moued him to the contrary. When that ſinfull woman came to bewayle hir ſinnes at the féete of CHRIST, ſhée was drawen with ſo greate a vehemencie and force, that if there had bene offered hir a thouſande worldes, with all the poſſible trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, pleaſures, honours, and felicyties of the worlde, ſhe could in no wiſe haue bene hindered nor ſtayed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:3278:96"/>Chriſt himſelfe ſayde vnto the Apoſtles, you haue not choſen mée, but I haue choſen you: as if he woulde ſaye, you are not come vnto mée by your owne accord, but bicauſe I haue drawen you.

               <p>Lyke as Chriſt expreſſed an other place, when talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge wyth the Citie of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> he ſayde: Howe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten woulde I haue gathered thy children together, as the Henne gathereth hir chickens vnder hir winges, and thou wouldeſt not? vnto the whiche wordes <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> adioyneth, ſpeakinge of the elect, and ſayeth, and hath gathered them together agaynſt thy will: for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as lyke as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> himſelfe ſayde in his <hi>Enchiridion,</hi> there is none ſo wicked which dare ſaye, that GOD can at any time when hée will, conuerte the wicked and drawe them vnto him, Although hée were vngratious and obſtinate, GOD can when he wyll, mollyfie his heart, and make him of wicked, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. There neuer was any holy man who in any wiſe, by his owne accorde went vnto CHRIST. They all haue bene by him drawen with the violence of loue. Thou thinkeſt peraduenture that CHRIST, for to ſée him ſo vppon the Croſſe, as a weake and fée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſon, and I ſay vnto thée, that as <hi>Paul</hi> did write, hée is the vertue and power of GOD which draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto him and ſaueth euery one that beholdeth him vppon the Croſſe with the eye of a lyuely fayth: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſayd. If I ſhall bée exalted vp, I wyll drawe all thinges vnto mée: that is, if béeinge faſtened and lyfted vp on the Croſſe, I ſhall bée exalted in the heartes of menne, ſo that they ſhall ſée mée wyth a liuely fayth, for the ſonne of GOD, crucified and deade, wyth greate Charitye for the loue of them,
<pb facs="tcp:3278:97"/>
I ſhall drawe euery thinge vnto mée, inaſmuch as I ſhall drawe vnto mée, not onely the ſpirite of ſuche as they bée, the minde, the vnderſtandinge, wyth all the thoughtes, the will with al the affections, the ſoule with all the powers, vertues, and operations, but alſo all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures, inaſmuch as ſeruinge vnto man, and he béeing by Chriſt drawen to the glorye of GOD, they alſo ſhall bée thorough Chriſt drawen in man to ſerue vnto the glory of GOD. Man in <hi>Adam</hi> was fallen, a ſtraunger from GOD, and in ſuche ſorte drowned in the worlde, and bound with yron cheines of humaine affections vnto creatures, that by himſelfe, not onelye he coulde not come vnto GOD, yea, his forces were all vnto worldly thinges. It is not ſufficient that God ſent the Patriarches, the Prophets, and the other Saynts, with bidding vs to his diuine wedding, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore béeing willing to drawe vs vnto him, he at the laſt ſent his owne ſonne in the forme of a ſeruaunt, and appoynted that he dying vpon the croſſe, ſhould giue vs ſuch and ſo greate light of his goodneſſe, and ſhould ſo make manifeſt vnto vs his loue, that we ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned and forced to come vnto him. Neither is it profitable that man ſhould bée ſuche a ſtraunger from God, ſo drowned in the worlde, vngratious, and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, that he myght not bée immediatlye drawen by Chriſt, if hée ſée him to bée the ſonne of GOD, and dead for hym, yea as calamytie draweth vnto it eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially hardneſſe, lykewiſe Chriſt draweth vnto him the great ſinners, ſo that they acknowledge them to be ſuch. All they therfore which be gone vnto Chriſt, and climed vp into heauen, are gone and climed thether by the force of loue, and likewiſe by force they doe abide, and ſhal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide there for euer. Chriſt then would chiefly ſuffer, for to declare vnto vs his moſt high loue, and therewith as with a moſt mightie thing, and moſt déere vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heart to enforce and draw vs vnto him. Foraſmuch as loue is
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:3278:97"/>
a ſpirituall fire which we doe not ſeeke to quench, but to nouriſh: it is a moſt pleaſant knot, from which we do not ſéeke to be vnbound, but to be faſt tyed: it is an amorous vyolence, againſt which we make no reſiſtaunce, yea eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one fauoureth it. He draweth vs not vnto him, but by drawing vs to the father, wherefore being vppon the Croſſe naked of all treaſures, pleaſures and worldly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites, he is ſhewed vnto vs altogether diuine. And if <hi>Noe</hi> coulde drawe the lyuing creatures into the Arke, how then ſhould not Chriſt be able to draw vs into his breaſt? The Angells could draw <hi>Lot</hi> out of <hi>Sodome,</hi> and ſhall not I beléeue that Chriſt can deliuer me from hell, and from all my ſinnes? I ſée that <hi>Moſes</hi> coulde drawe out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> ſo peruerſe and obſtinate people, and ſhal not I beleeue that Chriſt can draw me out of the world? <hi>Ioſua</hi> brought them into the lande of promiſe, and ſhall not I hope y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chriſt will conduct me into heauen? Chriſt in <hi>Peter</hi> conuerted and drew vnto him in one day thrée thouſand perſons, and in an other day fiue thouſande, in <hi>Paule</hi> as it were the whole world, wherefore I can-not doubt but that he will alſo draw me vnto him.

The multitude of people followed Chriſt thorough the wilderneſſe, euen till they had forgotten themſelues, being allured by his pleaſaunt words, and ſhall not I be drawen to follow Chriſt, ſéeing that for me he dyed v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Croſſe? the deafe heard, the blinde knew him, and the children praiſed him: and I ſeing that hée hath ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned my heart, lightened my minde, in this age, ſhal I not féele his great goodnes and loue with his moſt high and excéeding ſpirit, diſcouered vpon the croſſe: This can in no wiſe be poſſible, yea, it will of neceſſitie be that I continually loue my Ieſu, and that by him I be draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to render vnto the father for euer all praiſe, honour and glory.

Alſo it is not ſufficient to haue a certeine feeble deſire theroff, the which is found euen in the wicked: inaſmuch as they would alſo loue God, worke and ſuffer for his honour: yea it is not ſufficient to doe anye thing to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God if we be wicked, that with all our might and force we purpoſe and determine to worke for his honor, foraſmuch as whileſt we be wicked, we cannot worſhip God truely, nor lyft vp our head to his glory, with accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And more ouer it ſufficeth not that we imagine &amp; thinke that we worke for his glory: for that the Iewes alſo in crucifiyng Chriſt, and in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting his ſaints, thought that they did God ſeruice, as Chriſt foretolde vnto the Apoſtles. They ſuppoſed that they were moued by zeale of the honour God, but they deceiued themſelues as <hi>Paule</hi> did write: foraſmuch as in

truth if they had bene moued and drawen by the honour of God, they would not haue done things, which ſhoulde be to his diſhonour, as they did: and this bicauſe, ſéeing that the honour of God is in truth our laſt ende, it doth not drawe vs to doe any thing, but that which ſerueth to honour God. To make therefore in truth our purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes right, it muſt néedes be that we féele with the ſpirite a liuely Faith and light ſupernaturall, the goodneſſe of God in Chriſt, in ſuch ſort, that it can worke more in vs, then all the benefits of the world, ſo that louing it aboue all other things, we be drawn to doe things for his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: &amp; ſo much the more as that man with a liuely faith, ſéeing that Chriſt hath not onely delyuered him from al euill of this preſent life and of the lyfe to come, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo hath merited all, he could no more be moued to worke or ſuffer as a ſeruaunt, for his owne gaine: wherefore it ſhall of neceſſitie be, that as a regenerate heyre and Lord ouer all, and ſure of ſaluation, he ſhould be onelye moued to worke by the Sonne for the glorye of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Now theſe doe onely worſhip God in ſpirite and truth foraſmuch as they account him for their laſt ende: they alone doe truly loue him, not bicauſe he is good vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and beſtoweth benefits vpon them: but bicauſe he is good in himſelfe: and this is properly to loue God. They onely doe alſo acknowledge God and his name in truth: for that whereas others doe not feele nor knowe God, but in that he hath created them, preſerueth them, gouerneth, and beſtoweth benefites on them, wherefore they doe for his owne gaine, in himſelfe acknowledge him in his owne being, to be abſolutely, and with-out reſpect vnto creatures. Vnto theſe alſo the Heauen bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open as vnto <hi>Stephen,</hi> they ſee the glorye of God, wherefore they be moued to worke thereby. And albeit ſuch as theſe doe not actually thinke at all times to doe things vnto the glory of God, yet notwithſtanding lyke as all that which the Mariners doe, is that they might
<pb facs="tcp:3278:100"/>
be conducted vnto the hauen they ſéeke for, albeit they doe not alwayes actually thinke thereon: euen ſo the elect of God, and thoſe which haue with the ſpirite taſted the goodneſſe of God, be drawen to worke for his glorye, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they doe not alwayes actually thinke there on.</p>
               <p>Wherefore lyke as when thou caſteſt on thée a cloake, that not finding any let, is moued by ſome part, although thou doeſt not continually touche and daſh it with thy hande: and this by that firſt force which thou didſt vſe in caſting it on. Euen ſo when thou beginneſt to doe a good worke to the glory of God, although thou doſt not alwayes actually thinke to do it to the glory of God, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe in vertue of the firſt force, it is wholly to the glory of God, ſo that there is found no let, that is, ſo that afterward thou doſt not chaunge for to doe it with any wicked intent, repugning againſt the glory of God. It is very true, that as to ſhake this cloake oftentimes, will cauſe it ſway with much the greater force and ſwiftnes, ſo lykewiſe when we doe a good worke, the refreſhing of it oftentimes, the thinking by force of a liuely ſpirite to doe it to the glory of God, profiteth much to make vs do it with greater vehemencie. Lyke as therefore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Hounde if he feeleth not the ſmell of the Hare, runneth one while this way, another while that: but if he ſeeth it or féeleth the ſmel theroff, is moued and runneth to it with great ſpéede the right way, without turning either to the right hande or to the left: euen ſo he which féeleth not in Chriſt the great goodneſſe of God, is moued to worke, now by this worldly thing, and then by that: but he which fée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it is drawen to worke with-out ſtraying, with a right purpoſe, for the glory of God, the which as our ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme beatitude and laſt ende, we ought to haue alwaies before the eyes of our minde. Neither ought we account it a hard matter, to holde our minde alwayes lyfted vp vnto God, ſéeing that not onely the loue which he bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vs, and that he alwayes thinketh on vs, but more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:3278:100"/>
ouer how he béeing infinitelye good, hath made himſelfe knowen vnto vs, in beſtowing benefites vppon vs, with great exceſſe of his loue. To this ende he hath created vs, and done all that which he hath done, to the intent that knowing him for our firſt beginning, laſt ende, &amp; chiefe happines, with making his glory ſhine, we labour to ſet foorth his glory: which to doe, is a thing in it ſelfe ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, that in the world can nothing be done in it ſelfe ſo vile, which if it be done for the glory of God, is not glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in the ſight of God: like as alſo there can nothing be done in the world ſo gloryous in it ſelfe, that béeing done for humaine reſpects, is not moſt abiected in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſight of God. If thou ſhouldeſt giue all that thou haſt to the poore, &amp; thy body to the fire, if thou doſt it not for the loue of God, euery thing is loſt, as <hi>Paule</hi> did write. Although thou canſt not ſerue God vnrewarded, thou oughtſt not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſerue him without hauing reſpect vnto the reward, but only to ſerue for his glory. And when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eye of our purpoſe is ſo ſimple, ſincere &amp; pure all the body of our workes is lyght and acceptable vnto God. There is nothing that hurteth ſo much the arte of liuing well, as a peruerſe intent, the which diſordering the whole, and taking the honor from God, maketh men idolaters, and vaine: inaſmuch as all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which they worke and ſuffer, and not for the glory of God, is loſt &amp; caſt away, yea and ſinne in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſight of God, for that they are not done for the glory of God, as they ought to be. O how happy wer we if all that wée haue ſuffered and wroughte, euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till now, we had ſuffered and wrought for the glory of God: but we ought at leaſt to do ſo héereafter, and then euery thing that we ſhal do ſhal be acceptable vnto God: ſo that our purpoſe be right vnto him. Euery man ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to haue God for his laſt ende before his eyes, &amp; to order al his life vnto him, with chuſing thoſe things y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſerue moſt to his glory, &amp; with forſaking thoſe things which do hinder or ſtay vs, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out regarding things which appertaine not to vs: which we ſhall be conſtrained to
<pb facs="tcp:3278:101"/>
doe at any time when being in loue with God, we féele with the ſpirit in Chriſt his great goodneſſe. Let vs pray to God therfore that he would giue vs a liuely light of him, to the intent that hauing alwayes our eyes open to his honour, we maye render vnto him all prayſe, thorough Ieſus Chriſt our Lord. Amen.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S there is but one onely God, one onely Chriſt, &amp; one onely holy Ghoſt, one onely Faith, one onely Church, and one onely Goſpell: ſo lykewiſe vnto the world is but one onely diuine Lawe, imprinted alreadye by God in the minde of man, darkened by ſinne, expreſſed ſomewhat by morall Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, but much better by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and moſt perfectlye by Chriſt, and a new by Chriſt, the ſpirit of God being the guyde, powred in, imprinted, and written in the bowels, and in the hearts of the regenerate, as God afore time promiſed by his Prophet, They call notwithſtanding the naturall Law, thoſe canons, rules, and truth practiſed, of that which is right, and of that which is not right, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in the booke of the minde, in the which euery one reading, when he commeth to yeares of diſcretion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other maſter and booke, he diſcerneth by himſelfe good from euil. And the truth it ſelf, inaſmuch as by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> it was expreſſed in tables, is called the Law writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: wheras afterward by Chriſt, the holy Ghoſt being the guide, it was in a more perfect manner imprinted in the harts of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> regenerate, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is called the Euangelical law, of grace &amp; of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirit. Wher is to be noted, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> although a phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher hath for example, imprinted in minde this truth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God ought not to be diſhonoured, but honored, &amp; knew
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:3278:101"/>
that this thing is moſt right, yet notwithſtandinge hée obſerued not this moſt iuſt lawe. Yea, the <hi>Iewes,</hi> albeit they had this ſame truth, not only imprinted in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> minds but alſo expreſſed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tables of <hi>Moſes,</hi> &amp; diſcerned the righteous from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnrighteous, &amp; that with greater light then the Philoſophers, they could in no wiſe obſerue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> iuſt &amp; honeſt law, bicauſe they were letted by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſences. But in a Chriſtian already by faith regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, the goodneſſe of God thorough Chriſt is in ſuch ſort imprinted in his heart, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by the liuely, ſpirituall taſt &amp; feeling which he hath in Chriſt of God, he cannot diſhonour him, yea, by the ſpirit which he hath, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which preuayleth agaynſt his carnall concupiſences, he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned to honour him. And this according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of fayth which he hath. The Philoſopher then albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it he knew in part his bounden duetie, he did not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fulfill it bicauſe the fleſh reſiſted him. And in lyke caſe alſo the <hi>Iew,</hi> albeit he knew, &amp; that better then all the Philoſophers, what the wil of God is, neuertheleſſe béeing without Chriſt &amp; without grace, he obeied it not: Wherefore he ſhall be puniſhed the more grieuouſly, as hée had greater knowledge of the lawe of God. The naturall lawe therefore, &amp; much more the written law, is the Miniſter of death and damnation, whereas the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelicall law, of ſpirite &amp; of grace, is the miniſter of lyfe &amp; ſaluation: Wherefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of it, ſayd, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawe of the ſpirit of lyfe in Chriſt Ieſu, hath deliuered mée from the law of death &amp; of ſinne. The written law, therefore is vnperfect, although the naturall lawe be much more vnperfect, ſéeing that albeit they ſhew thoſe thinges which ought to be done, they doe not therefore giue the grace to be able to obſerue them. The law na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, then was as it were in darkneſſe, the lawe of <hi>Moſes</hi> in ſhadowes, &amp; the euangelicall law in light. The law natural came at midnight, <hi>Moſes</hi> lawe at the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and the euangelicall law at noone day. The natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb facs="tcp:3278:102"/>
lawe came with a little candle burning, <hi>Moſes</hi> lawe with a great torch, but couered, &amp; the euangelical law with the cléere light of the Sun. The natural law ſaw god in his creatures, <hi>Moſes</hi> law in the Scriptures, &amp; the euangelical law in Chriſt. The natural law ſéeth not Chriſt, <hi>Moſes</hi> law ſaw him and ſhewed him a farre off, &amp; the euangelicall law hath ſeene him openly, &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced him for his owne. The natural law hath imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced no man, <hi>Moſes</hi> law hath painted him out, with gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him coulours, the euangelical law hath giuen him ſpirit. The naturall lawe made him ſerue by reaſons, <hi>Moſes</hi> lawe for feare, &amp; the euangelicall lawe for loue. The natural lawe deliuereth vs from worldly infamy, <hi>Moſes</hi> law from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tyranny of <hi>Pharao,</hi> and the euangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call law from the tyranny of the world, of the fleſh, of ſinne, and of the diuell. The naturall law hath for the guide vnderſtandinge, <hi>Moſes</hi> lawe a piller of fire, and the euangelicall lawe the holy Ghoſt. The natural lawe is the lawe of the Philoſophers, <hi>Moſes</hi> law hath him for the author, &amp; the euangelicall law is of Chriſt. The naturall lawe féedeth men with worldly thinges, <hi>Moſes</hi> law with <hi>Manna,</hi> and the euangelical law with God. The natural law buildeth vp a worldly common wealth, <hi>Moſes</hi> law the holy citie of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and the euangelicall lawe the heauenly countrey. By the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall law we were ſtraungers, by <hi>Moſes</hi> law ſeruants, and by the euangelicall frée and the ſonnes of God. The naturall law guided vs to a certeine humaine felicity, <hi>Moſes</hi> lawe into the land of promiſe, and the euangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call law vnto heauen. The natural law is a burthen fit for humaine ſtrength, <hi>Moſes</hi> lawe is a burthen ſharp &amp; grieuous, and the euangelicall lawe is pleaſant &amp; delec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table The naturall law hath a reſpect to the comelines of vertues, <hi>Moſes</hi> law vnto felicitie, and the euangelical law vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glory of God. The naturall conducteth thee into <hi>Aegipt,</hi> &amp; there leaueth thee, <hi>Moſes</hi> law deliuereth
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:3278:102"/>
thée fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence, maketh thée walk thorough the deſert, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euangelical law bringeth thée into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> land of promiſe. The natural law begetteth thee vnto the world, <hi>Moſes</hi> law killeth thée vnto God, &amp; the euangelical law raiſeth thée againe. The natural law accuſeth thée, <hi>Moſes</hi> law condemneth thée, and the euangelicall law ſaueth thée. The naturall law awaketh man when he ſléepeth, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> law maketh him to tremble, and the euangelical law ſetteth him at reſt. The naturall lawe maketh men righteous in their owne ſight, <hi>Moſes</hi> law in the ſight of the world, and the euangelicall law maketh them righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in the ſight of God. The naturall lawe promiſeth not any thing that is ſupernaturall, <hi>Moſes</hi> law maketh promiſes of moſt rich diuine thinges, and the euangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call lawe obſerueth them. The naturall lawe maketh vs men, <hi>Moſes</hi> law maketh vs Angells, and the euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall law euen as Gods. Wherfore the natural law is good, <hi>Moſes</hi> law better, &amp; the euangelicall law beſt and moſt perfect. Let vs pray therefore vnto the Lorde, that hée would imprint it in our heartes, to the intent that we may render to him all prayſe, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and glory, thorough Ieſus Chriſt our Lord.
